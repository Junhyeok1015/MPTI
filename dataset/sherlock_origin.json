{"question":{"0":"Who was the first?","1":"Just in. Sixty-seven, natural causes. He used to work here. I knew him. He was nice.","2":"So, bad day, was it?","3":"Listen, I was wondering: maybe later, when you\u2019re finished ...","4":"I, er, I refreshed it a bit.","5":"I was wondering if you\u2019d like to have coffee.","6":"You\u2019ve no idea!","7":"And what\u2019s wrong with the landline?","8":"Er, here. Use mine.","9":"It\u2019s an old friend of mine, John Watson.","10":"Sorry?","11":"Afghanistan. Sorry, how did you know ...?","12":"Ah, Molly, coffee. Thank you.","13":"It wasn\u2019t working for me.","14":"... Okay.","15":"I\u2019m sorry, what?","16":"Then who said anything about flatmates?","17":"How did you know about Afghanistan?","18":"Got my eye on a nice little place in central London. Together we ought to be able to afford it.","19":"Is that it?","20":"We\u2019ve only just met and we\u2019re gonna go and look at a flat?","21":"We don\u2019t know a thing about each other; I don\u2019t know where we\u2019re meeting; I don\u2019t even know your name.","22":"I know you\u2019re an Army doctor and you\u2019ve been invalided home from Afghanistan. I know you\u2019ve got a brother who\u2019s worried about you but you won\u2019t go to him for help because you don\u2019t approve of him \u2013 possibly because he\u2019s an alcoholic; more likely because he recently walked out on his wife. And I know that your therapist thinks your limp\u2019s psychosomatic \u2013 quite correctly, I\u2019m afraid.","23":"That\u2019s enough to be going on with, don\u2019t you think?","24":"The name\u2019s Sherlock Holmes and the address is two two one B Baker Street.","25":"Yeah. He\u2019s always like that.","26":"Hello.","27":"Ah, Mr. Holmes.","28":"Well, this is a prime spot. Must be expensive.","29":"Sorry, you stopped her husband being executed?","30":"Sherlock, hello.","31":"Thank you.","32":"Well, this could be very nice. Very nice indeed.","33":"Yes. Yes, I think so. My thoughts precisely.","34":"So this is all ...","35":"That\u2019s a skull.","36":"I looked you up on the internet last night.","37":"Found your website, The Science of Deduction.","38":"You said you could identify a software designer by his tie and an airline pilot by his left thumb.","39":"What about these suicides then, Sherlock? I thought that\u2019d be right up your street. Three exactly the same.","40":"Four.","41":"A fourth?","42":"Brixton, Lauriston Gardens.","43":"You know how they never leave notes?","44":"This one did. Will you come?","45":"It\u2019s Anderson.","46":"Well, he won\u2019t be your assistant.","47":"Will you come?","48":"Thank you.","49":"Brilliant! Yes! Ah, four serial suicides, and now a note! Oh, it\u2019s Christmas!","50":"I\u2019m your landlady, dear, not your housekeeper.","51":"Not your housekeeper!","52":"Yes.","53":"Very good.","54":"Mmm, yes.","55":"Of course, yes. Enough for a lifetime. Far too much.","56":"Both of you?","57":"Look at you, all happy. It\u2019s not decent.","58":"Who cares about decent? The game, Mrs Hudson, is on!","59":"Taxi!","60":"Yeah, where are we going?","61":"Who are you? What do you do?","62":"I\u2019d say private detective ...","63":"... but the police don\u2019t go to private detectives.","64":"What does that mean?","65":"The police don\u2019t consult amateurs.","66":"Yes, how did you know?","67":"Bit different from my day.","68":"You said I had a therapist.","69":"Hmm?","70":"Your phone. It\u2019s expensive, e-mail enabled, MP3 player, but you\u2019re looking for a flatshare \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t waste money on this. It\u2019s a gift, then.","71":"The engraving.","72":"How can you possibly know about the drinking?","73":"Shot in the dark. Good one, though. Power connection: tiny little scuff marks around the edge of it. Every night he goes to plug it in to charge but his hands are shaking. You never see those marks on a sober man\u2019s phone; never see a drunk\u2019s without them.","74":"I was right? Right about what?","75":"That ... was amazing.","76":"Of course it was. It was extraordinary; it was quite extraordinary.","77":"What do people normally say?","78":"\u2018Piss off\u2019!","79":"Harry and me don\u2019t get on, never have. Clara and Harry split up three months ago and they\u2019re getting a divorce; and Harry is a drinker.","80":"And Harry\u2019s short for Harriet.","81":"Look, what exactly am I supposed to be doing here?","82":"No, seriously, what am I doing here?","83":"Hello, freak.","84":"Why?","85":"Why?","86":"Well, you know what I think, don\u2019t you?","87":"I don\u2019t ...  Er, who\u2019s this?","88":"Colleague of mine, Doctor Watson.","89":"Would it be better if I just waited and ...","90":"Freak\u2019s here. Bringing him in.","91":"It\u2019s a crime scene. I don\u2019t want it contaminated. Are we clear on that?","92":"Oh, don\u2019t pretend you worked that out. Somebody told you that.","93":"My deodorant?","94":"Well, of course it\u2019s for men! I\u2019m wearing it!","95":"So\u2019s Sergeant Donovan.","96":"Now look: whatever you\u2019re trying to imply ...","97":"I\u2019m not implying anything.","98":"I\u2019m sure Sally came round for a nice little chat, and just happened to stay over.","99":"And I assume she scrubbed your floors, going by the state of her knees.","100":"Who\u2019s this?","101":"But who is he?","102":"Aren\u2019t you gonna put one on?","103":"I can give you two minutes.","104":"Her name\u2019s Jennifer Wilson according to her credit cards. We\u2019re running them now for contact details. Hasn\u2019t been here long. Some kids found her.","105":"I didn\u2019t say anything.","106":"Got anything?","107":"She\u2019s German. \u2018Rache\u2019: it\u2019s German for \u2018revenge\u2019. She could be trying to tell us something \u2026.","108":"So she\u2019s German?","109":"Of course she\u2019s not. She\u2019s from out of town, though. Intended to stay in London for one night ...  ... before returning home to Cardiff.","110":"What about the message, though?","111":"Of the message?","112":"Wait, no, we have a whole team right outside.","113":"I\u2019m breaking every rule letting you in here.","114":"Yes, I do. God help me.","115":"Anderson, keep everyone out for a couple of minutes.","116":"What am I doing here?","117":"I\u2019m supposed to be helping you pay the rent.","118":"Fun? There\u2019s a woman lying dead.","119":"Yeah ... Asphyxiation, probably. Passed out, choked on her own vomit. Can\u2019t smell any alcohol on her. It could have been a seizure; possibly drugs.","120":"Sherlock \u2013 two minutes, I said. I need anything you\u2019ve got.","121":"Suitcase?","122":"Oh, for God\u2019s sake, if you\u2019re just making this up ...","123":"Cardiff?","124":"It\u2019s not obvious to me.","125":"Dear God, what is it like in your funny little brains? It must be so boring.","126":"That\u2019s fantastic!","127":"Sorry. I\u2019ll shut up.","128":"Why d\u2019you keep saying suitcase?","129":"She was writing \u2018Rachel\u2019?","130":"How d\u2019you know she had a suitcase?","131":"Back of the right leg: tiny splash marks on the heel and calf, not present on the left. She was dragging a wheeled suitcase behind her with her right hand. Don\u2019t get that splash pattern any other way. Smallish case, going by the spread. Case that size, woman this clothes-conscious: could only be an overnight bag, so we know she was staying one night.","132":"There wasn\u2019t a case.","133":"There wasn\u2019t a case. There was never any suitcase.","134":"Sherlock, there was no case!","135":"Right, yeah, thanks And ...?","136":"It\u2019s murder, all of them. I don\u2019t know how, but they\u2019re not suicides, they\u2019re killings \u2013 serial killings.","137":"Why are you saying that?","138":"She could have checked into a hotel, left her case there.","139":"No, she never got to the hotel. Look at her hair. She colour-coordinates her lipstick and her shoes. She\u2019d never have left any hotel with her hair still looking ...","140":"Oh.","141":"What is it, what?","142":"We can\u2019t just wait!","143":"Oh, we\u2019re done waiting!","144":"Of course, yeah \u2013 but what mistake?!","145":"What are you doing?","146":"Nicotine patch. Helps me think.","147":"It\u2019s good news for breathing.","148":"Is that three patches?","149":"You asked me to come. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s important.","150":"My phone?","151":"Mrs Hudson\u2019s got a phone.","152":"I was the other side of London.","153":"So what\u2019s this about \u2013 the case?","154":"Her case?","155":"Okay, he took her case. So?","156":"It\u2019s no use, there\u2019s no other way. We\u2019ll have to risk it.","157":"You brought me here ... to send a text.","158":"Text, yes. The number on my desk.","159":"Just met a friend of yours.","160":"An enemy.","161":"Your arch-enemy, according to him.  Do people have arch-enemies?","162":"Yes.","163":"No.","164":"Who is he?","165":"Jennifer Wilson. That was ... Hang on. Wasn\u2019t that the dead woman?","166":"Yes. That\u2019s not important. Just enter the number.","167":"Yes.","168":"Ye... hang on!","169":"These words exactly: \u201cWhat happened at Lauriston Gardens? I must have blacked out.\u201d","170":"You blacked out?","171":"What? No. No!","172":"Type and send it. Quickly.","173":"What\u2019s the address?","174":"That\u2019s ... that\u2019s the pink lady\u2019s case. That\u2019s Jennifer Wilson\u2019s case.","175":"Yes, obviously.","176":"I never said you did.","177":"Do people usually assume you\u2019re the murderer?","178":"How did you get this?","179":"Where?","180":"The killer must have driven her to Lauriston Gardens. He could only keep her case by accident if it was in the car. Nobody could be seen with this case without drawing attention \u2013 particularly a man, which is statistically more likely \u2013 so obviously he\u2019d feel compelled to get rid of it the moment he noticed he still had it. Wouldn\u2019t have taken him more than five minutes to realise his mistake. I checked every back street wide enough for a car five minutes from Lauriston Gardens ...","181":"... and anywhere you could dispose of a bulky object without being observed.","182":"Pink. You got all that because you realised the case would be pink?","183":"Why didn\u2019t I think of that?","184":"Because you\u2019re an idiot.","185":"No, no, no, don\u2019t look like that. Practically everyone is.","186":"From the case? How could I?","187":"Maybe she left it at home.","188":"Why did I just send that text?","189":"She could have lost it.","190":"The murderer ... You think the murderer has the phone?","191":"Sorry, what are we doing? Did I just text a murderer?! What good will that do?","192":"A few hours after his last victim, and now he receives a text that can only be from her. If somebody had just found that phone they\u2019d ignore a text like that, but the murderer ...","193":"Have you talked to the police?","194":"So why are you talking to me?","195":"So I\u2019m basically filling in for your skull?","196":"Relax, you\u2019re doing fine.","197":"Well what?","198":"What, you want me to come with you?","199":"I like company when I go out, and I think better when I talk aloud. The skull just attracts attention, so ...","200":"Yeah, Sergeant Donovan.","201":"She said ... You get off on this. You enjoy it.","202":"Where are we going?","203":"You think he\u2019s stupid enough to go there?","204":"Why?","205":"Yeah.","206":"This is his hunting ground, right here in the heart of the city. Now that we know his victims were abducted, that changes everything. Because all of his victims disappeared from busy streets, crowded places, but nobody saw them go.","207":"Dunno. Who?","208":"Haven\u2019t the faintest. Hungry?","209":"Thank you, Billy.","210":"He isn\u2019t just gonna ring the doorbell, though, is he? He\u2019d need to be mad.","211":"On the house, for you and for your date.","212":"This man got me off a murder charge.","213":"This is Angelo.","214":"He cleared my name.","215":"Nothing.  But for this man, I\u2019d have gone to prison.","216":"I\u2019m not his date!","217":"People don\u2019t have arch-enemies.","218":"In real life. There are no arch-enemies in real life. Doesn\u2019t happen.","219":"So who did I meet?","220":"Friends; people they know; people they like; people they don\u2019t like ... Girlfriends, boyfriends ...","221":"You don\u2019t have a girlfriend, then?","222":"Which is fine, by the way.","223":"So you\u2019ve got a boyfriend then?","224":"Right. Okay. You\u2019re unattached. Like me.  Fine.  Good.","225":"I\u2019m just saying, it\u2019s all fine.","226":"Good. Thank you.","227":"Look across the street. Taxi.","228":"Stopped. Nobody getting in, and nobody getting out.","229":"That\u2019s him?","230":"You\u2019re staring.","231":"I\u2019ve got the cab number.","232":"Good for you.","233":"Sorry.","234":"Come on, John.","235":"Come on, John. We\u2019re losing him!","236":"Ah, no!","237":"This way.","238":"Sorry.","239":"Police! Open her up!","240":"No.","241":"Teeth, tan: what \u2013 Californian?","242":"How can you possibly know that?","243":"The luggage.","244":"Sorry \u2013 are you guys the police?","245":"Yeah.","246":"Basically just a cab that happened to slow down.","247":"Not the murderer.","248":"Wrong country, good alibi.","249":"Right.  Detective Inspector Lestrade?","250":"Yeah. I pickpocket him when he\u2019s annoying. You can keep that one, I\u2019ve got plenty at the flat.","251":"Nothing, just: \u201cWelcome to London\u201d.","252":"That was the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever done.","253":"Why aren\u2019t we back at the restaurant?","254":"So what were we doing there?","255":"Oh, just passing the time.","256":"What point?","257":"You.","258":"Says who?","259":"Sherlock, what have you done?","260":"Upstairs.","261":"Well, I knew you\u2019d find the case. I\u2019m not stupid.","262":"And you can\u2019t withhold evidence. And I didn\u2019t break into your flat.","263":"Seriously?! This guy, a junkie?! Have you met him?!","264":"I\u2019m pretty sure you could search this flat all day, you wouldn\u2019t find anything you could call recreational.","265":"No.","266":"You?","267":"Shut up!","268":"No, Anderson\u2019s my sniffer dog.","269":"What, An...","270":"Are these human eyes?","271":"They were in the microwave!","272":"Or you could help us properly and I\u2019ll stand them down.","273":"Well, I\u2019m dealing with a child. Sherlock, this is our case. I\u2019m letting you in, but you do not go off on your own. Clear?","274":"It stops being pretend if they find anything.","275":"Is your flat? All of it?","276":"So let\u2019s work together. We\u2019ve found Rachel.","277":"Jennifer Wilson\u2019s only daughter.","278":"According to someone, the murderer has the case, and we found it in the hands of our favourite psychopath.","279":"I\u2019m not a psychopath, Anderson. I\u2019m a high-functioning sociopath. Do your research.","280":"She\u2019s dead.","281":"Excellent!","282":"Well, I doubt it, since she\u2019s been dead for fourteen years. Technically she was never alive. Rachel was Jennifer Wilson\u2019s stillborn daughter, fourteen years ago.","283":"Why would she think of her daughter in her last moments? Yup \u2013 sociopath; I\u2019m seeing it now.","284":"You said that the victims all took the poison themselves, that he makes them take it. Well, maybe he ... I don\u2019t know, talks to them? Maybe he used the death of her daughter somehow.","285":"Yeah, but that was ages ago. Why would she still be upset?","286":"Bit not good, yeah.","287":"\u201cPlease, God, let me live.\u201d","288":"I don\u2019t have to.","289":"Yeah, but if you were clever, really clever ... Jennifer Wilson running all those lovers: she was clever.","290":"Isn\u2019t the doorbell working? Your taxi\u2019s here, Sherlock.","291":"But they\u2019re just for my hip. They\u2019re herbal soothers.","292":"Your back, now, please!","293":"What about your taxi?","294":"MRS HUDSON!","295":"Oh.","296":"Ah! She was clever, clever, yes!","297":"She\u2019s cleverer than you lot and she\u2019s dead. Do you see, do you get it? She didn\u2019t lose her phone, she never lost it. She planted it on him.","298":"But how?","299":"Wha...? What do you mean, how?","300":"Rachel!","301":"Don\u2019t you see? Rachel!","302":"Then what is it?","303":"Er, jennie dot pink at mephone dot org dot uk.","304":"Oh, I\u2019ve been too slow. She didn\u2019t have a laptop, which means she did her business on her phone, so it\u2019s a smartphone, it\u2019s e-mail enabled.","305":"So there was a website for her account. The username is her e-mail address ...","306":"So we can read her e-mails. So what?","307":"We know he didn\u2019t.","308":"Sherlock, dear. This taxi driver ...","309":"Mrs Hudson, isn\u2019t it time for your evening soother?","310":"We need to get vehicles, get a helicopter.","311":"We\u2019ll just have a map reference, not a name.","312":"Sherlock ...","313":"Sherlock ...","314":"It\u2019s here. It\u2019s in two two one Baker Street.","315":"Well, maybe it was in the case when you brought it back and it fell out somewhere.","316":"Guys, we\u2019re also looking for a mobile somewhere here, belonged to the victim ...","317":"\u2018Who do we trust, even if we don\u2019t know them?\u2019","318":"\u2018Who passes unnoticed wherever they go?\u2019","319":"Sherlock, you okay?","320":"So, how can the phone be here?","321":"I\u2019ll try it again.","322":"Where are you going?","323":"You sure you\u2019re all right?","324":"Taxi for Sherlock \u2019olmes.","325":"Doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t need one.","326":"You\u2019re the cabbie. The one who stopped outside Northumberland Street.","327":"See? No-one ever thinks about the cabbie. It\u2019s like you\u2019re invisible. Just the back of an \u2019ead. Proper advantage for a serial killer.","328":"Oh, yeah. An\u2019 I\u2019ll tell you what else: if you call the coppers now, I won\u2019t run. I\u2019ll sit quiet and they can take me down, I promise.","329":"\u2019Cause you\u2019re not gonna do that.","330":"I will never tell you what I said.","331":"An\u2019 you won\u2019t ever understand how those people died. What kind of result do you care about?","332":"Let me take you for a ride.","333":"Okay, everybody. Done \u2019ere.","334":"Oh, I recognised yer, soon as I saw you chasing my cab. Sherlock \u2019olmes! I was warned about you. I\u2019ve been on your website, too. Brilliant stuff! Loved it!","335":"Just someone out there who\u2019s noticed you.","336":"Who?","337":"You\u2019re too modest, Mr. \u2019olmes.","338":"You\u2019ve got yourself a fan.","339":"And because Sherlock Holmes is a great man. And I think one day, if we\u2019re very, very lucky, he might even be a good one.","340":"You know every street in London. You know exactly where we are.","341":"It\u2019s open; cleaners are in. One thing about being a cabbie: you always know a nice quiet spot for a murder. I\u2019m surprised more of us don\u2019t branch out.","342":"And you just walk your victims in? How?","343":"Don\u2019t worry. It gets better.","344":"It\u2019s up to you. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s gonna die \u2019ere.","345":"Shall we talk?","346":"Ooh, you\u2019re going to love this.","347":"Sherlock \u2019olmes. Look at you! \u2019Ere in the flesh. That website of yours: your fan told me about it.","348":"Don\u2019t it make you mad? Why can\u2019t people just think?","349":"Don\u2019t look it, do I? Funny little man drivin\u2019 a cab. But you\u2019ll know better in a minute. Chances are it\u2019ll be the last thing you ever know.","350":"There\u2019s a good bottle and a bad bottle. You take the pill from the good bottle, you live; take the pill from the bad bottle, you die.","351":"In every way.","352":"Course I know.","353":"Wouldn\u2019t be a game if you knew. You\u2019re the one who chooses.","354":"Didn\u2019t expect that, did you, Mr. \u2019olmes?","355":"I want your best game.","356":"You ready yet, Mr. \u2019olmes? Ready to play?","357":"You\u2019re not playin\u2019 the numbers, you\u2019re playin\u2019 me. Did I just give you the good pill or the bad pill? Is it a bluff? Or a double-bluff? Or a triple-bluff?","358":"Four people in a row? It\u2019s not just chance.","359":"Or maybe God just loves me.","360":"Either way, you\u2019re wasted as a cabbie.","361":"Time to play.","362":"Oh, I am playing. This is my turn. There\u2019s shaving foam behind your left ear. Nobody\u2019s pointed it out to you.","363":"Traces of where it\u2019s happened before, so obviously you live on your own; there\u2019s no-one to tell you.","364":"But there\u2019s a photograph of children. The children\u2019s mother has been cut out of the picture. If she\u2019d died, she\u2019d still be there.","365":"The photograph\u2019s old but the frame\u2019s new. You think of your children but you don\u2019t get to see them.","366":"Estranged father. She took the kids, but you still love them and it still hurts.","367":"Ah, but there\u2019s more.","368":"Your clothes: recently laundered but everything you\u2019re wearing\u2019s at least ... three years old? Keeping up appearances but not planning ahead. And here you are on a kamikaze murder spree. What\u2019s that about?","369":"Told me what?","370":"So are you.","371":"Any breath could be my last.","372":"I\u2019ve outlived four people. That\u2019s the most fun you can \u2019ave on an aneurism.","373":"You are good, ain\u2019t you?","374":"When I die, they won\u2019t get much, my kids. Not a lot of money in driving cabs.","375":"You\u2019d be surprised.","376":"I \u2019ave a sponsor.","377":"For every life I take, money goes to my kids. The more I kill, the better off they\u2019ll be. You see? It\u2019s nicer than you think.","378":"You\u2019re not the only one to enjoy a good murder. There\u2019s others out there just like you, except you\u2019re just a man ... and they\u2019re so much more than that.","379":"Sherlock!","380":"Funnily enough, no-one\u2019s ever gone for that option.","381":"Are you sure?","382":"You don\u2019t wanna phone a friend?","383":"The gun.","384":"None of the others did.","385":"... which one\u2019s the good bottle?","386":"Innit good?","387":"Was I right?","388":"I was, wasn\u2019t I? Did I get it right?","389":"No.","390":"You\u2019re dying, but there\u2019s still time to hurt you. Give me a name.","391":"A name.","392":"Now.","393":"MORIARTY!","394":"Yeah, it\u2019s for shock.","395":"Yeah, but some of the guys wanna take photographs.","396":"Cleared off before we got \u2019ere. But a guy like that would have had enemies, I suppose. One of them could have been following him but ...  ... got nothing to go on.","397":"Okay, gimme.","398":"The bullet they just dug out of the wall\u2019s from a hand gun. Kill shot over that distance from that kind of a weapon \u2013 that\u2019s a crack shot you\u2019re looking for, but not just a marksman; a fighter. His hands couldn\u2019t have shaken at all, so clearly he\u2019s acclimatised to violence. He didn\u2019t fire until I was in immediate danger, though, so strong moral principle. You\u2019re looking for a man probably with a history of military service ...","399":"... and nerves of steel ...","400":"Sorry?","401":"Where\u2019re you going?","402":"But I\u2019ve still got questions for you.","403":"Sherlock!","404":"Um, Sergeant Donovan\u2019s just been explaining everything, the two pills. Been a dreadful business, hasn\u2019t it? Dreadful.","405":"Yes. Yes, must have been, through that window.","406":"Well, you\u2019d know.","407":"Need to get the powder burns out of your fingers. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d serve time for this, but let\u2019s avoid the court case.","408":"Yes, of course I\u2019m all right.","409":"But he wasn\u2019t a very nice man.","410":"And frankly a bloody awful cabbie.","411":"Stop! Stop, we can\u2019t giggle, it\u2019s a crime scene! Stop it!","412":"Sorry \u2013 it\u2019s just, um, nerves, I think.","413":"You were gonna take that damned pill, weren\u2019t you?","414":"No you didn\u2019t. It\u2019s how you get your kicks, isn\u2019t it? You risk your life to prove you\u2019re clever.","415":"Because you\u2019re an idiot.","416":"Starving.","417":"Sherlock. That\u2019s him. That\u2019s the man I was talking to you about.","418":"So, another case cracked. How very public spirited ... though that\u2019s never really your motivation, is it?","419":"As ever, I\u2019m concerned about you.","420":"Always so aggressive. Did it never occur to you that you and I belong on the same side?","421":"We have more in common than you like to believe. This petty feud between us is simply childish. People will suffer ... and you know how it always upset Mummy.","422":"I upset her? Me?","423":"No, no, wait. Mummy? Who\u2019s Mummy?","424":"Mother \u2013 our mother. This is my brother, Mycroft.","425":"He\u2019s your brother?!","426":"So he\u2019s not ...","427":"I dunno \u2013 criminal mastermind?","428":"For goodness\u2019 sake. I occupy a minor position in the British government.","429":"He is the British government, when he\u2019s not too busy being the British Secret Service or the CIA on a freelance basis.","430":"So: dim sum.","431":"No you can\u2019t.","432":"Sorry?","433":"Oh, yeah. Shoulder.","434":"No you didn\u2019t.","435":"Lucky guess.","436":"What are you so happy about?","437":"What\u2019s Moriarty?","438":"Right, keep it. Keep that.","439":"Look!","440":"Yeah, I didn\u2019t get the shopping.","441":"Because I had a row, in the shop, with a chip-and-PIN machine.","442":"Sort of. It sat there and I shouted abuse. Have you got cash?","443":"And what happened about that case you were offered \u2013 the Jaria Diamond?","444":"Not interested.","445":"Is that my computer?","446":"What?!","447":"It\u2019s password protected!","448":"Need to get a job.","449":"Sherlock, are you listening?","450":"Yes, when you said we were going to the bank ...","451":"Sherlock Holmes.","452":"Howdy, buddy. How long\u2019s it been? Eight years since I last clapped eyes on you?","453":"No?  We\u2019re all sorted here, thanks.","454":"Well, some.","455":"We were at uni together. This guy here had a trick he used to do.","456":"You\u2019d come down to breakfast in the Formal Hall and this freak would know you\u2019d been shagging the previous night.","457":"You\u2019re gonna tell me there was, um, a stain on my tie from some special kind of ketchup you can only buy in Manhattan.","458":"Maybe it was the mud on my shoes!","459":"So, someone came up here in the middle of the night, splashed paint around, then left within a minute.","460":"Every door that opens in this bank, it gets logged right here. Every walk-in cupboard, every toilet.","461":"This is an advance. Tell me how he got in, there\u2019s a bigger one on its way.","462":"How did you know?","463":"His watch?","464":"Within a month? How\u2019d you get that part?","465":"Breitling Chronometre Crosswind.).","466":"Okay. So d\u2019you think we should sniff around here for a bit longer?","467":"Hmm?","468":"... they\u2019ll lead us to the person who sent it.","469":"Well, there\u2019s three hundred people up there. Who was it meant for?","470":"What?","471":"Does it?","472":"Traders come to work at all hours. Some trade with Hong Kong in the middle of the night. That message was intended for someone who came in at midnight.","473":"Not many Van Coons in the phonebook.","474":"So what do we do now? Sit here and wait for him to come back?","475":"What?","476":"Could have just replaced it.","477":"Hello?","478":"No, well, uh, I\u2019ve just moved in.","479":"D\u2019you want me to buzz you in?","480":"D\u2019you think he\u2019d lost a lot of money? I mean, suicide is pretty common among City boys.","481":"Come on. The door was locked from the inside; you had to climb down the balcony.","482":"Been away three days, judging by the laundry.","483":"Thanks \u2013 I\u2019ll take your word for it.","484":"Yeah, I\u2019m not desperate to root around some bloke\u2019s dirty underwear.","485":"What, some sort of code?","486":"Obviously.","487":"Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t answering.","488":"No.","489":"What kind of a message would everyone try to avoid?","490":"Bills.","491":"... and see if you can get prints off this glass.","492":"Yeah, I know who you are; and I\u2019d prefer it if you didn\u2019t tamper with any of the evidence.","493":"That does seem the only explanation of all the facts.","494":"Wrong. It\u2019s one possible explanation of some of the facts.","495":"Like?","496":"And?","497":"Van Coon was left-handed.","498":"Left-handed?","499":"Oh, I\u2019m amazed you didn\u2019t notice. All you have to do is look around this flat.","500":"Coffee table on the left-hand side; coffee mug handle pointing to the left. Power sockets: habitually used the ones on the left ...","501":"No, I think you\u2019ve covered it.","502":"Oh, I might as well; I\u2019m almost at the bottom of the list.","503":"There\u2019s a knife on the breadboard with butter on the right side of the blade because he used it with his left.","504":"It\u2019s highly unlikely that a left-handed man would shoot himself in the right side of his head.","505":"But the gun: why ...","506":"Today at the bank. Sort of a warning.","507":"And the bullet?","508":"Oh, come on! What are the chances of that?!","509":"But if his door was locked from the inside, how did the killer get in?","510":"... and he\u2019s left trying to sort of cut his hair with a fork, which of course can never be done!","511":"I\u2019m kind of in a meeting. Can you make an appointment with my secretary?","512":"Killed?","513":"It\u2019s my Chairman. The police have been on to him. Apparently they\u2019re telling him it was a suicide.","514":"Well, I\u2019m afraid they don\u2019t see it like that.","515":"Oh!  Well, I look forward to it!","516":"What? When?","517":"Yeah, I went to see about a job at that surgery.","518":"It\u2019s great. She\u2019s great.","519":"The job.","520":"... It.","521":"The intruder who can walk through walls.","522":"God. You think ...","523":"He\u2019s killed another one.","524":"Brian Lukis, freelance journalist. Murdered in his flat ...","525":"Both men killed by someone who can ...  ... walk through solid walls.","526":"Inspector, do you seriously believe that Eddie Van Coon was just another City suicide?","527":"Mmm.","528":"No.","529":"No. So this investigation might move a bit quicker if you were to take my word as gospel.","530":"I\u2019ve just handed you a murder enquiry.  Five minutes in his flat.","531":"Four floors up. That\u2019s why they think they\u2019re safe. Put a chain across the door and bolt it shut; think they\u2019re impregnable.","532":"I don\u2019t understand.","533":"What are you doing?","534":"He clings to the walls like an insect.","535":"What?!","536":"You\u2019re not serious! Like Spiderman?","537":"Oh, ho-hold on!","538":"And of course that\u2019s how he got into the bank. He ran along the window ledge and onto the terrace.","539":"We have to find out what connects these two men.","540":"Sherlock.","541":"So, the killer goes to the bank, leaves a threatening cipher for Van Coon; Van Coon panics, returns to his apartment, locks himself in.","542":"The killer finds Lukis at the library; he writes the cipher on the shelf where he knows it\u2019ll be seen; Lukis goes home.","543":"Why did they die, Sherlock?","544":"Only the cipher can tell us.","545":"Yes, okay, but ...","546":"Where are we headed?","547":"What?! Sorry?!","548":"You need advice?","549":"Part of a new exhibition.","550":"Can we do this while I\u2019m workin\u2019?","551":"Recognise the paint. It\u2019s like Michigan; hardcore propellant. I\u2019d say zinc.","552":"Not even sure it\u2019s a proper language.","553":"What, and this is all you\u2019ve got to go on? It\u2019s hardly much, now, is it?","554":"I\u2019ll ask around.","555":"Perhaps she was getting a bit of unwanted attention.","556":"Just formalities: fingerprints, charge sheet; and I\u2019ve gotta be in Magistrates Court on Tuesday.","557":"Me, Sherlock, in court on Tuesday.  They\u2019re givin\u2019 me an ASBO!","558":"You wanna tell your little pal he\u2019s welcome to go and own up any time.","559":"This symbol: I still can\u2019t place it.","560":"Oy, oy, oy!","561":"Oh, Jesus!","562":"His personal effects will have been impounded. Get hold of his diary, or something that will tell us his movements.","563":"Flew back from Dalian Friday. Looks like he had back-to-back meetings with the sales team.","564":"Sure.","565":"This is what you wanted, isn\u2019t it? The journalist\u2019s diary?","566":"Um, no. That\u2019s not a word I\u2019d use. The only things Eddie appreciated had a big price tag.","567":"5, the receipt is for \u00a318.50. He hands it up to Amanda.).","568":"That would get him to the office.","569":"The West End. I remember him saying.","570":"So he got a Tube back to the office. Why would he get a taxi into town and then the Tube back?","571":"Delivering?","572":"To somewhere near Piccadilly Station. Dropped the package, delivered it and then ...","573":"... stopped on his way. He got peckish.","574":"Right.","575":"Sherlock ...","576":"Sherlock ...","577":"That shop over there.","578":"Lukis\u2019 diary.  He was here too. He wrote down the address.","579":"The label there.","580":"Exactly the same as the cipher.","581":"It\u2019s an ancient number system! Hangzhou.","582":"These days, only street traders use it. Those were numbers written on the wall at the bank and at the library.","583":"It\u2019s a fifteen! What we thought was the artist\u2019s tag \u2013 it\u2019s a number fifteen.","584":"And the blindfold \u2013 the horizontal line? That was a number as well.","585":"Two men travel back from China. Both head straight for the Lucky Cat emporium. What did they see?","586":"Thank you.","587":"Lost five million ...","588":"Mmm.","589":"He was a smuggler. Mmm.","590":"A guy like him \u2013 it would have been perfect.","591":"Mmm-hmm.","592":"... making frequent trips to Asia. And Lukis was the same ...","593":"Mmm.","594":"But why did they die? I mean, it doesn\u2019t make sense. If they both turn up at the shop and deliver the goods, why would someone threaten them and kill them after the event, after they\u2019d finished the job?","595":"How d\u2019you mean?","596":"And the killer doesn\u2019t know which of them took it, so he threatens them both. Right.","597":"Remind me ...","598":"... when was the last time that it rained?","599":"It\u2019s been here since Monday.","600":"Could\u2019ve gone on holiday.","601":"Sherlock!","602":"Someone else has been here.","603":"Can you not keep doing this, please?","604":"What?","605":"What are you saying?","606":"Size eight feet.","607":"I\u2019m wasting my breath.","608":"Small, strong hands.","609":"Our acrobat.","610":"But why didn\u2019t he close the window when he left ...?","611":"Any time you want to include me.","612":"\u201c... my MASSIVE INTELLECT!\u201d","613":"Somebody?","614":"But how, exactly?","615":"You\u2019ve gone all croaky. Are you getting a cold?","616":"I\u2019m fine.","617":"Just left her work unfinished.","618":"She does this demonstration for the tourists \u2013 a-a tea ceremony. So she would have packed up her things and just put them in here.","619":"Tuesday morning, all you\u2019ve gotta do is turn up and say the bag was yours.","620":"Dude, that was rad!","621":"There. I spotted it earlier.","622":"Yeah.","623":"I don\u2019t understand. It-it was here ...  ... ten minutes ago. I saw it. A whole load of graffiti!","624":"Hey, Sherlock, what are you doing ...?","625":"What are you doing?!","626":"Yeah.","627":"Yes, definitely.","628":"Yes!","629":"Well, don\u2019t worry ...","630":"Yeah, well, don\u2019t worry \u2013 I remember all of it.","631":"I took a photograph.","632":"Hmm?","633":"God, I need to sleep.","634":"No idea.","635":"Just twenty minutes.","636":"Of course.","637":"Of course! He wants information. He\u2019s trying to communicate with his people in the underworld. Whatever was stolen, he wants it back.","638":"Somewhere here in the code.","639":"Oh, good.","640":"What are you looking at?","641":"Th-the pots were her obsession. Um, they need urgent work. If-if they dry out, then the clay can start to crumble. Apparently you have to just keep making tea in them.","642":"Yesterday, only one of those pots was shining. Now there are two.","643":"Fancy a biscuit with that?","644":"Centuries old. Don\u2019t wanna break that.","645":"You saw the cipher. Then you know he is coming for me.","646":"I had to finish ... to finish this work. It\u2019s only a matter of time. I know he will find me.","647":"When I was a girl, living back in China. I recognise his ... \u2018signature\u2019.","648":"Zhi Zhu?","649":"You know this mark?","650":"Hmm?","651":"I was fifteen. My parents were dead. I had no livelihood; no way of surviving day to day except to work for the bosses.","652":"They gave me a job here. Everything was good; a new life.","653":"I turned my brother away. He said I had betrayed him. Next day I came to work and the cipher was waiting.","654":"These are numbers.","655":"Here: the line across the man\u2019s eyes \u2013 it\u2019s the Chinese number one.","656":"I have to go and help. Bolt the door after me.","657":"Careful!","658":"Some of those skulls are over two hundred thousand years old! Have a bit of respect!","659":"A young girl was gunned down tonight. That\u2019s three victims in three days. You\u2019re supposed to be finding him.","660":"Can you prove that?","661":"Oh, it\u2019s you!","662":"This place is never going to trouble Egon Ronay, is it?","663":"What are you having?","664":"So you\u2019re working here tonight?","665":"\u201cSome\u201d?","666":"They\u2019re on my list.","667":"Well ... the paperwork\u2019s already gone through.","668":"What?","669":"Yes, well ...","670":"Mmm, it\u2019s good; it, um, suits you better this way.","671":"The feet?","672":"Yes. D\u2019you mind if we have a look at them?","673":"Now Van Coon.","674":"So ...","675":"What do you want?","676":"Their books?","677":"Soo Lin said the name.","678":"We\u2019re still no closer to finding them.","679":"Wrong. We\u2019ve got almost all we need to know. She gave us most of the missing pieces.","680":"She worked at the museum.","681":"An expert in antiquities. Mmm, of course. I see.","682":"And the Black Lotus is selling them.","683":"Check for the dates ...","684":"Mmm.","685":"Arrived from China four days ago.","686":"One in Lukis\u2019 suitcase and one in Van Coon\u2019s.","687":"... antiquities sold at auction.","688":"Mmm.","689":"Ah, look: a month before that \u2013 a Chinese painting, half a million.","690":"And every single auction coincides with Lukis or Van Coon travelling to China.","691":"Sorry. Are we collecting for charity, Sherlock?","692":"A young man\u2019s outside with crates of books.","693":"To books.","694":"Right, so ... fifteen and one: that means ...","695":"Okay. So what\u2019s the message?","696":"Anything else I can do? To assist you, I mean?","697":"Some silence right now would be marvellous.","698":"Ah.","699":"And I don\u2019t have one tonight.","700":"A book that everybody would own.","701":"Fifteen. Entry one.","702":"Actually, I\u2019ve, er, got a date.","703":"It\u2019s where two people who like each other go out and have fun.","704":"No it wasn\u2019t ... at least I hope not.","705":"Er, cinema.","706":"Oh, dull, boring, predictable.","707":"Why don\u2019t you try this?","708":"No, I don\u2019t think so. We only booked two.","709":"And then I phoned back and got one for myself as well.","710":"Er, hi.","711":"You couldn\u2019t let me have just one night off?","712":"... dressed as a tightrope walker. Come on, Sherlock, behave!","713":"Fine. You do that; I\u2019m gonna take Sarah for a pint.","714":"I do have a couple of other things on my mind this evening!","715":"You are kidding.","716":"Sherlock, I\u2019m right in the middle of a date. D\u2019you want me to chase some killer while I\u2019m trying to ...","717":"You said circus. This is not a circus. Look at the size of this crowd. Sherlock, this is ...  ... art.","718":"No, sorry, I forgot. They\u2019re not a circus; they\u2019re a gang of international smugglers.","719":"Hmm?","720":"Oh, Gawd! I\u2019m sorry!","721":"Did you see that?!","722":"Well, well.","723":"Come on.","724":"I sent a couple of cars. The old hall is totally deserted.","725":"Lukis and Van Coon were part of a-a smuggling operation. Now, one of them stole something when they were in China; something valuable.","726":"They\u2019ll be back in China by tomorrow.","727":"No, they won\u2019t leave without what they came for. We need to find their hide-out; the rendezvous.","728":"No, no, you don\u2019t have to go ...  ... does she?  You can stay.","729":"Is it just me, or is anyone else starving?","730":"So this is what you do, you and John. You solve puzzles for a living.","731":"What are these squiggles?","732":"So these numbers \u2013 it\u2019s a cipher.","733":"And each pair of numbers is a word.","734":"Well, two words have already been translated, here.","735":"Mmm?","736":"John, look at this.","737":"Soo Lin at the museum \u2013 she started to translate the code for us. We didn\u2019t see it!","738":"Does that mean \u2018millions\u2019?","739":"Nine million quid. For what?","740":"Where are you going?","741":"To the museum; to the restoration room.","742":"At-at what?","743":"The book, John. The book \u2013 the key to cracking the cipher!","744":"Soo Lin used it to do this! Whilst we were running around the gallery, she started to translate the code. It must be on her desk.","745":"Hey, du! Siehst du nicht wo du hingehst? [Hey, you! Why don\u2019t you look where you\u2019re going?","746":"Und dann sagen die, dass die Engl\u00e4nder h\u00f6flich sind! [And they say the English are polite!","747":"A book that everybody would own.","748":"Hey, du! Was macht du? [Hey, you! What are you doing?","749":"Yeah!","750":"Page fifteen, entry one. Page fifteen, entry one ...","751":"Dead man. You were threatening to kill them.","752":"It\u2019s the first cipher.","753":"Thirty-seven, nine; thirty-seven, nine ...","754":"Yeah!","755":"Sixty, thirty-five.","756":"I don\u2019t understand.","757":"\u201cNINE MILL FOR JADE PIN DRAGON DEN BLACK ...  ... TRAMWAY.\u201d","758":"John! John! I\u2019ve got it!","759":"Debit card, name of S. Holmes.","760":"It tells you that they\u2019re not really trying.","761":"Tramway.","762":"Oh, Christ.","763":"I don\u2019t believe you.","764":"You should, you know.","765":"Sherlock Holmes is nothing at all like him.","766":"Late?","767":"Well?","768":"Well ...","769":"... the radius curvature of these walls is nearly four metres. If you miss, the bullet will ricochet. Could hit anyone. Might even bounce off the tunnel and hit you.","770":"It\u2019s all right.","771":"Don\u2019t worry. Next date won\u2019t be like this.","772":"Mr. Holmes ...","773":"I go where you point me.","774":"So, \u201cNine mill\u201d ...","775":"Million, yes; \u201cNine million for jade pin. Dragon den, black Tramway.\u201d","776":"Mmm.","777":"What, a jade pin?","778":"Hang on: a hairpin worth nine million pounds?","779":"Why so much?","780":"Depends who owned it.","781":"Worth nine million pounds.","782":"How d\u2019you know it was Van Coon, not Lukis? Even the killer didn\u2019t know that.","783":"Amanda.","784":"Oh. Hello.","785":"How do you know that?","786":"Someone\u2019s been gossiping.","787":"Then I don\u2019t understand. Why ...?","788":"Scented hand soap in his apartment.","789":"Sorry?","790":"Look, it wasn\u2019t serious between us. It was over in a flash. It couldn\u2019t last \u2013 he was my boss.","791":"I thought he didn\u2019t appreciate me. Took me for granted. Stood me up once too often \u2013 we\u2019d plan to go away for the weekend and then he\u2019d just leave; fly off to China at a moment\u2019s notice.","792":"And he brought you a present from abroad to say sorry.","793":"Said he bought it in a street market.","794":"Yeah, that\u2019s Eddie.","795":"Oh? What\u2019s it worth?","796":"Over a thousand years old and it\u2019s sitting on her bedside table every night.","797":"Hmm. Should\u2019ve just got her a lucky cat.","798":"You mind, don\u2019t you?","799":"That she escaped \u2013 General Shan. It\u2019s not enough that we got her two henchmen.","800":"You cracked the code, though, Sherlock; and maybe Dimmock can track down all of them now that he knows it.","801":"The Great Game.","802":"She was always gettin\u2019 at me, sayin\u2019 I weren\u2019t a real man.","803":"What?","804":"Oh.","805":"He learned us how to cut up a beast.","806":"What?","807":"Yeah, well, then-then I done it.","808":"Everyone says you\u2019re the best. Without you, I\u2019ll get hung for this.","809":"No, no, no, Mr. Berwick, not at all.","810":"What the hell are you doing?","811":"What?","812":"No ...","813":"Bored! Bored!","814":"So you take it out on the wall.","815":"What about that Russian case?","816":"A severed head!","817":"No, there\u2019s a head in the fridge.","818":"A bloody head!","819":"Well, where else was I supposed to put it?","820":"You don\u2019t mind, do you?","821":"I got it from Bart\u2019s morgue.","822":"I\u2019m measuring the coagulation of saliva after death.","823":"Uh, yes.","824":"Well, you know, pink lady, pink case, pink phone \u2013 there was a lot of pink. Did you like it?","825":"Why not? I thought you\u2019d be flattered.","826":"Now hang on a minute. I didn\u2019t mean that in a ...","827":"I know ...","828":"Whether the Earth goes round the Sun ...","829":"It\u2019s primary school stuff. How can you not know that?","830":"\u201cDeleted it\u201d?","831":"Listen.  This is my hard drive, and it only makes sense to put things in there that are useful ... really useful.","832":"But it\u2019s the solar system!","833":"Oh, hell! What does that matter?!","834":"So we go round the Sun! If we went round the Moon, or round and round the garden like a teddy bear, it wouldn\u2019t make any difference. All that matters to me is the work. Without that, my brain rots.","835":"Put that in your blog. Or better still, stop inflicting your opinions on the world.","836":"Ooh, it\u2019s a bit nippy out there. He should have wrapped himself up a bit more.","837":"Oh, I\u2019m sure something\u2019ll turn up, Sherlock. A nice murder \u2013 that\u2019ll cheer you up.","838":"Sherlock. Sherlock!","839":"I saw it on the telly. Are you okay?","840":"Hmm? What?  Oh, yeah. Fine. Gas leak, apparently.","841":"\u201cCan\u2019t\u201d?","842":"Never mind your usual trivia. This is of national importance.","843":"I\u2019m afraid my brother can be very intransigent.","844":"Besides, a case like this \u2013 it requires ...  ... legwork.","845":"Sofa, Sherlock. It was the sofa.","846":"You\u2019ve got to find those plans, Sherlock. Don\u2019t make me order you.","847":"You\u2019ve got nothing on \u2013 not a single case. That\u2019s why the wall took a pounding. Why did you tell your brother you were busy?","848":"Sibling rivalry. Now we\u2019re getting somewhere.","849":"Sherlock Holmes.","850":"Of course. How could I refuse?","851":"If you want me to.","852":"Of course.","853":"You like the funny cases, don\u2019t you? The surprising ones.","854":"You\u2019ve love this. That explosion ...","855":"No.","856":"Hardly anything left of the place except a strong box \u2013 a very strong box and inside it was this.","857":"We\u2019ve X-rayed it. It\u2019s not booby-trapped.","858":"How reassuring.","859":"What?","860":"No.","861":"\u201cShe\u201d?","862":"What, from the Study in Pink?","863":"Well, obviously it\u2019s not the same phone but it\u2019s supposed to look like ...","864":"Course I read his blog! We all do. D\u2019you really not know that the Earth goes round the Sun?","865":"It isn\u2019t the same phone. This one\u2019s brand new.","866":"Is that it?","867":"What the hell are we supposed to make of that? An estate agent\u2019s photo and the bloody Greenwich pips!","868":"A warning?","869":"Some secret societies used to send dried melon seeds, orange pips, things like that. Five pips. They\u2019re warning us it\u2019s gonna happen again.","870":"H-hang on. What\u2019s gonna happen again?","871":"Boom!","872":"You had a look, didn\u2019t you, Sherlock, when you first came to see about your flat.","873":"He\u2019s a bomber, remember.","874":"H-hello ... sexy.","875":"I\u2019ve ... sent you ... a little puzzle ... just to say hi.","876":"... and this ... stupid ... bitch ... is reading it out.","877":"What?","878":"No, what did you mean?","879":"So, who d\u2019you suppose it was?","880":"The woman on the phone \u2013 the crying woman.","881":"For God\u2019s sake, I wasn\u2019t thinking about leads.","882":"Are-are they trying to trace it, trace the call?","883":"The bomber\u2019s too smart for that.","884":"Where is it?","885":"Jacket.","886":"Text from your brother.","887":"Delete it?","888":"Well, Mycroft thinks there is. He\u2019s texted you eight times. Must be important.","889":"His what?","890":"Try and remember there\u2019s a woman here who might die.","891":"What for?","892":"This hospital\u2019s full of people dying, Doctor. Why don\u2019t you go and cry by their bedside and see what good it does them?","893":"Any luck?","894":"Jim works in I.T. upstairs. That\u2019s how we met. Office romance.","895":"Sorry, what?","896":"What d\u2019you mean, gay? We\u2019re together.","897":"Two and a half.","898":"He\u2019s not gay. Why d\u2019you have to spoil ...? He\u2019s not.","899":"Because he puts a bit of product in his hair? I put product in my hair.","900":"His underwear?","901":"Visible above the waistline \u2013 very visible; very particular brand.","902":"Charming. Well done.","903":"\u201cKinder\u201d? No, no, Sherlock. That wasn\u2019t kind.","904":"Mmm?","905":"No.","906":"I\u2019m not gonna stand here so you can humiliate me while I try and disseminate ...","907":"Yeah, right.","908":"I dunno \u2013 they\u2019re just a pair of shoes.  Trainers.","909":"Uh, they\u2019re very eighties \u2013 probably one of those retro designs.","910":"Well, they\u2019re quite big, so a man\u2019s.","911":"But there\u2019s traces of a name inside in felt-tip. Adults don\u2019t write their names inside their shoes, so these belonged to a kid.","912":"Uh ...  ... that\u2019s it.","913":"How did I do?","914":"Well, John; really well.","915":"I mean, you missed almost everything of importance, but, um, you know ...","916":"The owner loved these. Scrubbed them clean, whitened them where they got discoloured. Changed the laces three ... no, four times.","917":"Twenty years?","918":"They\u2019re not retro \u2013 they\u2019re original.","919":"But there\u2019s still mud on them. They look new.","920":"How do you know?","921":"Pollen. Clear as a map reference to me.","922":"So what happened to him?","923":"Something bad.","924":"He loved those shoes, remember. He\u2019d never leave them filthy. Wouldn\u2019t leave them go unless he had to. So: a child with big feet gets ...","925":"What?","926":"Sorry, who?","927":"What is it?","928":"It\u2019s where I began.","929":"Nineteen eighty-nine, a young kid \u2013 champion swimmer \u2013 came up from Brighton for a school sports tournament; drowned in the pool. Tragic accident.","930":"But you remember.","931":"Something fishy about it?","932":"Started young, didn\u2019t you?","933":"What?","934":"What about them?","935":"They weren\u2019t there. I made a fuss; I tried to get the police interested, but nobody seemed to think it was important. He\u2019d left all the rest of his clothes in his locker, but there was no sign of his shoes ...","936":"How does he know my number?","937":"Look, he did say \u2018national importance\u2019.","938":"What is?","939":"You can\u2019t just ignore it.","940":"He-he\u2019s fine, yes. Oh, and-and it is going ... very well. It\u2019s, um, you know \u2013 he\u2019s completely focussed on it.","941":"What you going on about?","942":"Clostridium botulinum!","943":"It\u2019s one of the deadliest poisons on the planet!","944":"Oh, wait, are you saying he was murdered?","945":"Mmm.","946":"What \u2013 how-how come the autopsy didn\u2019t pick that up?","947":"It\u2019s virtually undetectable. Nobody would have been looking for it.","948":"But there were still tiny traces of it left inside the trainers from where he put the cream on his feet.","949":"So how do we let the bomber know ...","950":"Mmm-hmm.","951":"The killer kept the shoes all these years.","952":"Well done, you. Come and get me.","953":"Told her to phone you. She had to read out from this pager.","954":"Or if you hadn\u2019t solved the case.","955":"But what was the point? Why would anyone do this?","956":"Four pips.","957":"First test passed, it would seem. Here\u2019s the second.","958":"Freak, it\u2019s for you.","959":"It\u2019s okay that you\u2019ve gone to the police.","960":"Carl laughed at me, so I stopped him laughing.","961":"This is about you and me.","962":"Who are you?","963":"Before you ask, yes, it\u2019s Monkford\u2019s blood. The DNA checks out.","964":"Not yet.","965":"Get a sample sent to the lab.","966":"No, we\u2019re not from the police; we\u2019re ...","967":"Sherlock Holmes. Very old friend of your husband\u2019s. We, um ...","968":"I\u2019m sorry, who? I don\u2019t think he ever mentioned you.","969":"Oh, he must have done. This is ... this is horrible, isn\u2019t it?","970":"Sorry, but my husband has been depressed for months. Who are you?","971":"No, it isn\u2019t. He forgot to renew the tax on the car, that\u2019s all.","972":"No it wasn\u2019t.","973":"Why did you lie to her?","974":"Sorry, what?","975":"You think she murdered her husband?","976":"Where now?","977":"Janus Cars.","978":"Yeah. Lovely motor. Mazda RX-8. Wouldn\u2019t mind one of them myself!","979":"No, they\u2019re all Jags. Yeah, I can see you\u2019re not a car man, eh?","980":"No, he was just a client. Came in here and hired one of my cars. No idea what happened to him. Poor sod.","981":"Eh?","982":"No, it\u2019s, er, sunbeds, I\u2019m afraid, yeah. Too busy to get away. My wife would love it, though \u2013 bit of sun.","983":"What?","984":"Well, I noticed one on the way in and I haven\u2019t got any change.","985":"No, sorry.","986":"Oh well. Thank you very much for your time, Mr. Ewert.","987":"I-I\u2019ve got change if you still want to, uh ...","988":"So what was that all about?","989":"Why?","990":"Mr. Ewert\u2019s a liar.","991":"The clue\u2019s in the name. Janus Cars.","992":"Why does anyone do anything? Because I\u2019m bored. We were made for each other, Sherlock.","993":"Patience.","994":"How much? About a pint.","995":"Frozen?","996":"Who did?","997":"The god with two faces.","998":"Mmm.","999":"So where is he?","1000":"Columbia?!","1001":"Mr. Ewert of Janus Cars had a twenty thousand Columbian peso note in his wallet ...","1002":"... Quite a bit of change, too. He told us he hadn\u2019t been abroad recently, but when I asked him about the cars, I could see his tan line clearly.","1003":"His arm?","1004":"Kept scratching it. Obviously irritating him, and bleeding.","1005":"M-Mrs Monkford?","1006":"Oh yes. She\u2019s in on it too.","1007":"Now go and arrest them, Inspector. That\u2019s what you do best.","1008":"We need to let our friendly bomber know that the case is solved.","1009":"He says you can come and fetch me. Help. Help me, please.","1010":"Has it occurred to you ...?","1011":"No \u2013 has it occurred to you that the bomber\u2019s playing a game with you? The envelope; breaking into the other flat; the dead kid\u2019s shoes \u2013 it\u2019s all meant for you.","1012":"Is it him, then? Moriarty?","1013":"Perhaps.","1014":"Well, it could be, yeah. Lucky for you, I\u2019ve been more than a little unemployed.","1015":"Anyway, speaking of silk purses and sows\u2019 ears ...","1016":"I\u2019ll give you ... twelve hours.","1017":"Connie Prince, fifty-four. She had one of those make-over shows on the telly. Did you see it?","1018":"Very popular. She was going places.","1019":"Not any more. So: dead two days. According to one of her staff, Raoul de Santos, she cut her hand on a rusty nail in the garden. Nasty wound.","1020":"I suppose.","1021":"Eh?","1022":"Can\u2019t be as simple as it seems, otherwise the bomber wouldn\u2019t be directing us towards it. Something\u2019s wrong.","1023":"Mmm.","1024":"Yeah.","1025":"But the wound\u2019s clean \u2013 very clean, and fresh.","1026":"After she was dead?","1027":"Must have been. The only question is, how did the tetanus enter the dead woman\u2019s system?","1028":"Of course.","1029":"There\u2019s something else that we haven\u2019t thought of.","1030":"If this woman\u2019s death was suspicious, why point it out?","1031":"... who press-gangs suicide bombers?","1032":"I\u2019m \u2013 I\u2019m serious, Sherlock. Listen: I\u2019m cutting you slack here; I\u2019m trusting you \u2013 but out there somewhere, some poor bastard\u2019s covered in Semtex and is just waiting for you to solve the puzzle. So just tell me: what are we dealing with?","1033":"maps, photographs of Connie Prince \u2013 both when she was alive and pictures taken in the morgue \u2013 photos of Carl Powers, press cuttings and various sheets of paper with notes scribbled on them. Pieces of string are pinned between some of the exhibits, linking them together. Sherlock is pacing back and forth in front of the sofa as Lestrade stands nearby.","1034":"Connection, connection, connection. There must be a connection.","1035":"Absolutely.","1036":"Who was that?","1037":"Home Office?","1038":"Did you ever see her show?","1039":"That\u2019s the brother. No love lost there, if you can believe the papers.","1040":"You fire away.","1041":"Hi. Look, get over here quickly. I think I\u2019m onto something. You\u2019ll need to pick up some stuff first. You got a pen?","1042":"What?","1043":"Yes.","1044":"Yes; thank you.","1045":"You were right. The bacteria got into her another way.","1046":"Not too close. I\u2019m raw from crying.","1047":"Sekhmet. Named after the Egyptian goddess.","1048":"Sherlock? Uh, light reading?","1049":"Oh, um ...","1050":"Bloody hell. What do you think you\u2019re playing at?!","1051":"Sherlock.","1052":"Yes! Ooh, yes!","1053":"What? No, yes. Yeah, it is. It must be. It\u2019s how they got the tetanus into her system. Its paws stink of disinfectant.","1054":"No, he coated it onto the paws of her cat. It\u2019s a new pet \u2013 bound to be a bit jumpy around her. A scratch is almost inevitable. She wouldn\u2019t have ...","1055":"He murdered his sister for her money.","1056":"Didn\u2019t he?","1057":"Revenge? Who wanted revenge?","1058":"What about the disinfectant, then, on the cat\u2019s claws?","1059":"Raoul keeps a very clean house. You came through the kitchen door, saw the state of that floor, scrubbed to within an inch of its life. You smell of disinfectant now. No, the cat doesn\u2019t come into it.","1060":"Raoul\u2019s internet records do, though. Hope we can get a cab from here.","1061":"Raoul de Santos is your killer. Kenny Prince\u2019s houseboy. Second autopsy shows it wasn\u2019t tetanus that poisoned Connie Prince \u2013 it was botulinum toxin.","1062":"So how\u2019d he do it?","1063":"Botox?","1064":"Botox is a diluted form of botulinum. Among other things, Raoul de Santos was employed to give Connie her regular facial injections. My contact at the Home Office gave me the complete records of Raoul\u2019s internet purchases.  He\u2019s been bulk ordering Botox for months.","1065":"You sure about this?","1066":"Hey, Sherlock. How long?","1067":"How long have you known?","1068":"No, but Sherl\u2026 The hostage\u2026 the old woman. She\u2019s been there all this time.","1069":"I knew I could save her. I also knew that the bomber had given us twelve hours. I solved the case quickly; that gave me time to get on with other things. Don\u2019t you see? We\u2019re one up on him!","1070":"Help me.","1071":"He was so ... His voice ...","1072":"He sounded so ... soft.","1073":"He certainly gets about.","1074":"Well, obviously I lost that round \u2013 although technically I did solve the case.","1075":"He killed the old lady because she started to describe him.","1076":"What d\u2019you mean?","1077":"What ... like the Connie Prince murder \u2013 he-he arranged that? So people come to him wanting their crimes fixed up, like booking a holiday?","1078":"\u201cConnie Prince: man arrested\u201d. Raoul is shoved into the back of a police car. John looks round at Sherlock, who is looking down at the pink phone.).","1079":"Anything on the Carl Powers case?","1080":"Maybe the killer was older than Carl?","1081":"So why\u2019s he doing this, then \u2013 playing this game with you? D\u2019you think he wants to be caught?","1082":"I hope you\u2019ll be very happy together.","1083":"There are lives at stake, Sherlock \u2013 actual human lives\u2026 Just - just so I know, do you care about that at all?","1084":"Nope.","1085":"And you find that easy, do you?","1086":"No.  No.","1087":"That\u2019s good \u2013 that\u2019s a good deduction, yeah.","1088":"Don\u2019t make people into heroes, John. Heroes don\u2019t exist, and if they did, I wouldn\u2019t be one of them.","1089":"Excellent!","1090":"View of the Thames. South Bank \u2013 somewhere between Southwark Bridge and Waterloo.","1091":"You check the papers; I\u2019ll look online ...","1092":"Oh, you\u2019re angry with me, so you won\u2019t help.","1093":"Archway suicide.","1094":"Ah. Man found on the train line \u2013 Andrew West.","1095":"Nothing!","1096":"D\u2019you reckon this is connected, then? The bomber?","1097":"But we must assume that some poor bugger\u2019s primed to explode, yeah?","1098":"Any ideas?","1099":"There\u2019s quite a bit of bruising around the nose and mouth. More bruises here and here.","1100":"In his late thirties, I\u2019d say. Not in the best condition.","1101":"He\u2019s been in the river a long while. The water\u2019s destroyed most of the data.","1102":"What?","1103":"Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. What painting? What are you \u2013 what are you on about?","1104":"Okay. So what has that got to do with the stiff?","1105":"It\u2019s a horror story, isn\u2019t it? What are you saying?","1106":"Jewish folk story. A gigantic man made of clay. It\u2019s also the name of an assassin \u2013 real name Oskar Dzundza \u2013 one of the deadliest assassins in the world.","1107":"So this is a hit?","1108":"But what has this gotta do with that painting? I don\u2019t see ...","1109":"All right, all right, girls, calm down. Sherlock? D\u2019you wanna take us through it?","1110":"Security guard?","1111":"Backside?!","1112":"Why regular? Maybe he just set his alarm like that the night before he died.","1113":"No-no-no, the buttons are stiff, hardly touched. He set his alarm like that a long time ago. His routine never varied. But there\u2019s something else. The killer must have been interrupted, otherwise he would have stripped the corpse completely. There was some kind of badge or insignia on the shirt front that he tore off, suggesting the dead man worked somewhere recognisable, some kind of institution.","1114":"Found this inside his trouser pockets.","1115":"Tickets?","1116":"Ticket stubs. He worked in a museum or gallery. Did a quick check \u2013 the Hickman Gallery has reported one of its attendants as missing.","1117":"Fantastic.","1118":"I\u2019d better get my feelers out for this Golem character.","1119":"Who?","1120":"Me.","1121":"Why hasn\u2019t he phoned? He\u2019s broken his pattern. Why?","1122":"Where now? The Gallery?","1123":"The Hickman\u2019s contemporary art, isn\u2019t it? Why have they got hold of an Old Master?","1124":"Dunno. Dangerous to jump to conclusions. Need data.","1125":"Stop!","1126":"Change? Any change?","1127":"Cup of tea, of course.","1128":"What are you doing?","1129":"Investing.","1130":"Now we go to the Gallery.","1131":"Have you got any cash?","1132":"Don\u2019t you have something to do?","1133":"Yes. Lovely. Now get back to work. We open tonight.","1134":"What?","1135":"What?","1136":"It\u2019s a fake. It has to be. It\u2019s the only possible explanation.","1137":"Who are you?","1138":"Golem? What the hell are you talking about?","1139":"It\u2019s not a fake.","1140":"What the hell are you on about? You know, I could have you sacked on the spot.","1141":"No?","1142":"How did you get in?","1143":"I want to know.","1144":"Who are you?","1145":"Am I supposed to be impressed?","1146":"You should be.","1147":"Alex Woodbridge didn\u2019t know anything special about art.","1148":"And ...","1149":"No, give us a chance! He was an amateur astronomer.","1150":"Spare change, sir?","1151":"Can you wait here?","1152":"Fortunately, I haven\u2019t been idle.","1153":"Come on.","1154":"I thought you didn\u2019t care about things like that.","1155":"Listen: Alex Woodbridge had a message on the answerphone at his flat \u2013 a Professor Cairns?","1156":"Nice Nice part of town. Er, any time you wanna explain.","1157":"Homeless network?","1158":"Oh, that\u2019s clever. So you scratch their backs and ...","1159":"Sherlock!","1160":"What\u2019s he doing sleeping rough?","1161":"Oh shi\u2026.","1162":"I wish I\u2019d ...","1163":"Don\u2019t mention it.","1164":"Or not. I have an idea where he might be going.","1165":"... composed mainly of hydrogen. Their light takes so long to reach us ...","1166":"Golem!","1167":"I can\u2019t see him. I\u2019ll go round. I\u2019ll go!","1168":"... long dead, exploded into supernovas.","1169":"That painting has been subjected to every test known to science.","1170":"It\u2019s a very good fake, then.","1171":"Inspector, my time is being wasted. Would you mind showing yourself and your friends out?","1172":"The painting is a fake.","1173":"It\u2019s a fake. That\u2019s why Woodbridge and Cairns were killed.","1174":"Oh, come on. Proving it\u2019s just the detail. The painting is a fake. I\u2019ve solved it. I\u2019ve figured it out. It\u2019s a fake! That\u2019s the answer. That\u2019s why they were killed.","1175":"What did he say?","1176":"Nine ...","1177":"Jesus!","1178":"Eight ...","1179":"Seven ...","1180":"No, shut up. Don\u2019t say anything. It only works if I figure it out.","1181":"Come on.","1182":"Sherlock.","1183":"Four ...","1184":"What\u2019s brilliant? What is?","1185":"Sherlock!","1186":"Somebody help me!","1187":"There you go. Go find out where he is and pick him up.","1188":"Oh Sherl\u2026.","1189":"You know, it\u2019s interesting. Bohemian stationery, an assassin named after a Prague legend, and you, Miss Wenceslas. This whole case has a distinctly Czech feeling about it. Is that where this leads?","1190":"I found a little old man in Argentina. Genius. I mean, really: brushwork immaculate, could fool anyone.","1191":"Well, nearly anyone.  But I didn\u2019t know how to go about convincing the world the picture was genuine. It was just an idea \u2013 a spark which he blew into a flame.","1192":"Well, there was never any real contact; just messages ... whispers.","1193":"Right: so, uh, Andrew West got on the train somewhere \u2013 or did he? There\u2019s no ticket on the body. Then how did he end up here?","1194":"Yes!","1195":"How long have you been following me?","1196":"Since the start. You don\u2019t think I\u2019d give up on a case like this just to spite my brother, do you?","1197":"Come on. Got a bit of burglary to do.","1198":"Yeah, I know. I\u2019ve met them.","1199":"Sherlock! What if there\u2019s someone in?","1200":"Where are we?","1201":"Joe ...?","1202":"Brother of West\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.","1203":"Then why\u2019d he do it?","1204":"I swear it was.","1205":"I just didn\u2019t have a clue what to do, so I dragged him in \u2019ere, and I just sat in the dark, thinking.","1206":"When a neat little idea popped into your head.","1207":"And points.","1208":"D\u2019you still have it, then? The memory stick?","1209":"Fetch it for me \u2013 if you wouldn\u2019t mind.","1210":"Well, maybe that\u2019s over, too. We\u2019ve heard nothing from the bomber.","1211":"Five pips, remember, John? It\u2019s a countdown. We\u2019ve only had four.","1212":"Knew it was dangerous.","1213":"Getting you into crap telly.","1214":"Have you given Mycroft the memory stick yet?","1215":"You know, I\u2019m still waiting.","1216":"For you to admit that a little knowledge of the solar system and you\u2019d have cleared up the fake painting a lot quicker.","1217":"No, but I\u2019m not the world\u2019s only consulting detective.","1218":"I won\u2019t be in for tea. I\u2019m going to Sarah\u2019s. There\u2019s still some of that risotto left in the fridge.","1219":"Uh, milk. We need milk.","1220":"Really?!","1221":"And some beans, then?","1222":"Mmm.","1223":"This is a turn-up, isn\u2019t it, Sherlock?","1224":"Gottle o\u2019 geer ... gottle o\u2019 geer ... gottle o\u2019 geer.","1225":"Nice touch, this: the pool where little Carl died. I stopped him.  I can stop John Watson too.  Stop his heart.","1226":"... or are you just pleased to see me?","1227":"... like you!","1228":"\u201cDear Jim. Please will you fix it for me to get rid of my lover\u2019s nasty sister?\u201d","1229":"Just so.","1230":"Isn\u2019t it? No-one ever gets to me \u2013 and no-one ever will.","1231":"You\u2019ve come the closest. Now you\u2019re in my way.","1232":"Didn\u2019t mean it as a compliment.","1233":"Although I have loved this \u2013 this little game of ours.  Playing Jim from I.T.  Playing gay. Did you like the little touch with the underwear?","1234":"That\u2019s what people DO!","1235":"No you won\u2019t.","1236":"You can talk, Johnny-boy. Go ahead.","1237":"D\u2019you know what happens if you don\u2019t leave me alone, Sherlock, to you?","1238":"I\u2019ll burn the heart out of you.","1239":"Well, so nice to have had a proper chat.","1240":"Ciao, Sherlock Holmes.","1241":"No you won\u2019t!","1242":"All right?","1243":"Are you okay?","1244":"Me? Yeah, I\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine. Fine.","1245":"I\u2019m glad no-one saw that.","1246":"You, ripping my clothes off in a darkened swimming pool. People might talk.","1247":"You can\u2019t be allowed to continue. You just can\u2019t. I would try to convince you but ...  ... everything I have to say has already crossed your mind!","1248":"D\u2019you mind if I get that?","1249":"Sorry. Wrong day to die.","1250":"What happened there?","1251":"Yes, Miss Adler.","1252":"Blog.","1253":"Us.","1254":"Why?","1255":"Well, you\u2019re typing a lot.","1256":"My wife seems to be spending a very long time at the office.","1257":"I think my husband might be having an affair.","1258":"She\u2019s not my real aunt. She\u2019s been replaced \u2013 I know she has. I know human ash.","1259":"We are prepared to offer any sum of money you care to mention for the recovery of these files.","1260":"But then all the comic books started coming true.","1261":"Oh. Interesting.","1262":"It\u2019s the title.","1263":"What does it need a title for?","1264":"Where d\u2019you think our clients come from?","1265":"Right then: dyed blonde hair; no obvious cause of death except for these speckles, whatever they are.","1266":"What?","1267":"They wouldn\u2019t let us see Granddad when he was dead. Is that \u2019cause he\u2019d gone to heaven?","1268":"There was a plane crash in Dusseldorf yesterday. Everyone dead.","1269":"Any ideas?","1270":"Eight, so far.","1271":"Okay, four ideas.","1272":"Maybe two ideas.","1273":"People want to know you\u2019re human.","1274":"\u2019Cause they\u2019re interested.","1275":"One thousand, eight hundred and ninety-five.","1276":"I re-set that counter last night. This blog has had nearly two thousand hits in the last eight hours.

A couple of them specifically wanted photographs of you two.","1281":"For God\u2019s sake!","1282":"John.","1283":"Still, it\u2019s good for the public image, a big case like this.","1284":"Ooh!","1285":"You realise this is a tiny bit humiliating?","1286":"It\u2019s okay, I\u2019m fine.","1287":"I didn\u2019t really mean for you.","1288":"Look, this is a six.","1289":"When did we agree that?","1290":"We agreed it yesterday. Stop!","1291":"I wasn\u2019t even at home yesterday. I was in Dublin.","1292":"Well, it\u2019s hardly my fault you weren\u2019t listening.","1293":"D\u2019you just carry on talking when I\u2019m away?","1294":"It\u2019s there.","1295":"You\u2019ve got two more minutes, then I want to know more about the driver.","1296":"I think he\u2019s a suspect!","1297":"All right, but there\u2019s a Mute button and I will use it.","1298":"Okay, just take it, take it.","1299":"He\u2019s trying to be clever. It\u2019s over-confidence.","1300":"Did you see him? Morbidly obese, the undisguised halitosis of a single man living on his own, the right sleeve of an internet porn addict and the breathing pattern of an untreated heart condition. Low self-esteem, tiny IQ and a limited life expectancy \u2013 and you think he\u2019s an audacious criminal mastermind?!","1301":"What did you say? Heart what?","1302":"What\u2019s in the stream?","1303":"His room\u2019s through the back. Get him some clothes.","1304":"Three small dogs.","1305":"Are you wearing any pants?","1306":"What are we doing here, Sherlock? Seriously, what?","1307":"Here to see the Queen?","1308":"We solve crimes, I blog about it and he forgets his pants, so I wouldn\u2019t hold out too much hope.","1309":"What, the hiker and the backfire?

Not here.","1318":"I\u2019ll be mother.","1319":"A matter has come to light of an extremely delicate and potentially criminal nature, and in this hour of need, dear brother, your name has arisen.","1320":"People do come to you for help, don\u2019t they, Mr. Holmes?","1321":"What do you know about this woman?","1322":"She\u2019s been at the centre of two political scandals in the last year, and recently ended the marriage of a prominent novelist by having an affair with both participants separately.","1323":"There are many names for what she does. She prefers \u2018dominatrix\u2019.","1324":"Don\u2019t be alarmed. It\u2019s to do with sex.","1325":"She provides \u2013 shall we say \u2013 recreational scolding for those who enjoy that sort of thing and are prepared to pay for it.  These are all from her website.","1326":"You\u2019re very quick, Mr. Holmes.","1327":"A young female person.","1328":"A considerable number, apparently.","1329":"Yes, they do.","1330":"An imaginative range, we are assured.","1331":"Can you help us, Mr. Holmes?","1332":"Will you take the case?","1333":"She got in touch, she informed us that the photographs existed, she indicated that she had no intention to use them to extort either money or favour.","1334":"Sherlock ...","1335":"Hmm.","1336":"Uh, in London currently. She\u2019s staying ...","1337":"Do you really think you\u2019ll have news by then?","1338":"One can only hope you\u2019re as good as you seem to think.","1339":"Anything you require. I\u2019ll have it sent to ...","1340":"I\u2019m sorry?","1341":"I don\u2019t smoke.","1342":"We have kept a lot of people successfully in the dark about this little fact, Mr. Holmes.","1343":"And that\u2019s as modest as he gets. Pleasure to meet you.","1344":"Okay, the smoking. How did you know?","1345":"Observe what?","1346":"What are you doing?","1347":"Going into battle, John. I need the right armour.","1348":"So, what\u2019s the plan?","1349":"What, just ring her doorbell?","1350":"Exactly.","1351":"You didn\u2019t even change your clothes.","1352":"Are we here?","1353":"For what?","1354":"Punch you?","1355":"I always hear \u2018punch me in the face\u2019 when you\u2019re speaking, but it\u2019s usually sub-text.","1356":"Ow!","1357":"Thank you. That was \u2013 that was ...","1358":"You wanna remember, Sherlock: I was a soldier. I killed people.","1359":"Hello?","1360":"I can phone the police if you want.","1361":"Thank you, thank you!

So every time they text you ...","1377":"I\u2019m wondering who could have got hold of your phone, because it would have been in your coat, wouldn\u2019t it?","1378":"I\u2019m not stupid, you know.","1379":"Bond Air is go, that\u2019s decided. Check with the Coventry lot. Talk later.","1380":"What else does she have?","1381":"Irene Adler. The Americans wouldn\u2019t be interested in her for a couple of compromising photographs.

Christmas is cancelled!","1396":"People like the hat.","1397":"Oh, God. Sorry.","1398":"That\u2019s first thing in the morning. Me and the wife \u2013 we\u2019re back together.

She\u2019s off the booze.","1400":"Shut up, Sherlock.","1401":"Sorry, what?","1402":"Shut up and have a drink.","1403":"Oh, come on. Surely you\u2019ve all seen the present at the top of the bag \u2013 perfectly wrapped with a bow.

So, why don\u2019t ... Oh, for ...","1478":"For protection. I make my way in the world; I misbehave. I like to know people will be on my side exactly when I need them to be.","1479":"I told you \u2013 I misbehave.","1480":"Yes, but I don\u2019t understand it.","1481":"I assumed. Show me.","1482":"It\u2019s not working.","1483":"No, because it\u2019s a duplicate that I had made, into which you\u2019ve just entered the numbers one oh five eight.","1484":"I told you that camera phone was my life.

There\u2019s a row thirteen, which eliminates the more superstitious airlines. Then there\u2019s the style of the flight number \u2013 zero zero seven \u2013 that eliminates a few more; and assuming a British point of origin, which would be logical considering the original source of the information and assuming from the increased pressure on you lately that the crisis is imminent, the only flight that matches all the criteria and departs within the week is the six thirty to Baltimore tomorrow evening from Heathrow Airport.","1489":"I would have you right here on this desk until you begged for mercy twice.","1490":"Uh-huh.

Because this was textbook: the promise of love, the pain of loss, the joy of redemption; then give him a puzzle ...  ... and watch him dance.","1515":"Mr. Holmes, I think we need to talk.","1516":"Sherlock, dear, tell him what you found when you X-rayed my camera phone.","1517":"There are four additional units wired inside the casing, I suspect containing acid or a small amount of explosive.","1518":"Sherlock?","1519":"Nicely played.","1520":"Sorry?","1521":"I said no. Very very close, but no.","1522":"No such thing as too much.","1523":"Sentiment? What are you talking about?","1524":"Oh dear God. Look at the poor man. You don\u2019t actually think I was interested in you? Why? Because you\u2019re the great Sherlock Holmes, the clever detective in the funny hat?","1525":"No.","1526":"Because I took your pulse.","1527":"Elevated; your pupils dilated.","1528":"I imagine John Watson thinks love\u2019s a mystery to me but the chemistry is incredibly simple, and very destructive.","1529":"When we first met, you told me that disguise is always a self-portrait. How true of you: the combination to your safe \u2013 your measurements; but this ...  ... this is far more intimate.","1530":"This is your heart ...","1531":"... and you should never let it rule your head.","1532":"You could have chosen any random number and walked out of here today with everything you\u2019ve worked for ...","1533":"... but you just couldn\u2019t resist it, could you?","1534":"I\u2019ve always assumed that love is a dangerous disadvantage ...","1535":"Everything I said: it\u2019s not real.  I was just playing the game.","1536":"I know.","1537":"And this is just losing.","1538":"I\u2019m certain they will.","1539":"Are you expecting me to beg?","1540":"I won\u2019t even last six months.","1541":"So ...  ...what should we tell Sherlock?","1542":"Clearly you\u2019ve got news.","1543":"Hi. Er, no, it\u2019s, um ...  ... it\u2019s about Irene Adler.","1544":"No, she\u2019s, er ... I just bumped into Mycroft downstairs. He had to take a call.","1545":"She\u2019s in America.","1546":"Mmm-hmm. Got herself on a witness protection scheme, apparently. Dunno how she swung it, but, er, well, you know.","1547":"Well, you won\u2019t be able to see her again.","1548":"Didn\u2019t say you did.","1549":"Do you want to ...?","1550":"Listen, actually ...","1551":"There\u2019s nothing on it any more. It\u2019s been stripped.","1552":"I know, but I ...","1553":"Sherlock, I have to give this to Mycroft. It\u2019s the government\u2019s now. I couldn\u2019t even give ...","1554":"Please.","1555":"Well, I\u2019d better take this back.","1556":"Did she ever text you again, after ... all that?","1557":"What did she say?","1558":"Huh.","1559":"When I say run, run!","1560":"The Woman.","1561":"What is it, dear? Are you lost?","1562":"You went on the Tube like that?!","1563":"None of the cabs would take me.","1564":"Military coup in Uganda.","1565":"Oh, um, Cabinet reshuffle.","1566":"Nothing of importance?","1567":"Oh, God!","1568":"No.","1569":"Anyway, you\u2019ve paid everyone off, remember? No-one within a two mile radius\u2019ll sell you any.","1570":"Stupid idea. Whose idea was that?","1571":"Look, Sherlock, you\u2019re doing really well. Don\u2019t give up now.","1572":"Tell me where they are. Please. Tell me.","1573":"Can\u2019t help, sorry.","1574":"I\u2019ll let you know next week\u2019s lottery numbers.","1575":"Ooh-ooh!","1576":"Eh?","1577":"Ooh, chance would be a fine thing.","1578":"How about a nice cuppa, and perhaps you could put away your harpoon.","1579":"I need something stronger than tea. Seven per cent stronger.","1580":"Pardon?","1581":"Sherlock ...","1582":"Thumbnail: tiny traces of foil. Been at the scratch cards again. We all know where that leads, don\u2019t we?","1583":"Please.","1584":"Sherlock!","1585":"What the bloody hell was all that about?","1586":"Go after her and apologise.","1587":"Mmm-hmm.","1588":"You envy me?","1589":"You\u2019ve just solved one! By harpooning a dead pig, apparently!","1590":"That was this morning!","1591":"Nothing on the website?","1592":"Bluebell?","1593":"Oh.","1594":"Ah, but there\u2019s more! Before Bluebell disappeared, it turned luminous ...","1595":"... \u201clike a fairy\u201d according to little Kirsty; then the next morning, Bluebell was gone! Hutch still locked, no sign of a forced entry ...","1596":"Are you serious?","1597":"We are never playing that again!","1598":"Because it\u2019s not actually possible for the victim to have done it, Sherlock, that\u2019s why.","1599":"It\u2019s not in the rules.","1600":"Single ring.","1601":"It was dark, but I know what I saw. I know what killed my father.","1602":"Oh.  I ... I was just about to say.","1603":"In your own time.","1604":"Do you know Dartmoor, Mr. Holmes?","1605":"It\u2019s an amazing place. It\u2019s like nowhere else. It\u2019s sort of ... bleak but beautiful.","1606":"We used to go for walks, after my mum died, my dad and me. Every evening we\u2019d go out onto the moor.","1607":"That\u2019s an ancient name for the Devil.","1608":"Hmm.  Red eyes, coal-black fur, enormous: dog? Wolf?","1609":"Are you laughing at me, Mr. Holmes?","1610":"My dad was always going on about the things they were doing at Baskerville; about the type of monsters they were breeding there. People used to laugh at him. At least the TV people took me seriously.","1611":"I\u2019m not sure you can help me, Mr. Holmes, since you find it all so funny.","1612":"How ... how do you know?","1613":"I didn\u2019t know; I noticed.","1614":"It\u2019s not important ...","1615":"Not now, Sherlock.","1616":"You\u2019re just showing off.","1617":"Of course. I am a show-off. That\u2019s what we do.","1618":"How did you know it was disappointing?","1619":"Is there any other type of breakfast on a train? The girl \u2013 female handwriting\u2019s quite distinctive. Wrote her phone number down on the napkin. I can tell from the angle she wrote at that she was sat across from you on the other side of the aisle. Later \u2013 after she got off, I imagine \u2013 you used the napkin to mop up your spilled coffee, accidentally smudging the numbers. You\u2019ve been over the last four digits yourself with another pen, so you wanted to keep the number. Just now, though, you used the napkin to blow your nose. Maybe you\u2019re not that into her after all. Then there\u2019s the nicotine stains on your fingers ... your shaking fingers. I know the signs.","1620":"No chance to smoke one on the train; no time to roll one before you got a cab here.","1621":"You\u2019re right. You\u2019re completely, exactly right. Bloody hell, I heard you were quick.","1622":"It\u2019s my job.","1623":"Who?","1624":"My therapist.","1625":"Louise Mortimer. She\u2019s the reason I came back to Dartmoor. She thinks I have to face my demons.","1626":"Makes you feel so cold inside, so afraid.","1627":"Yes, if I wanted poetry, I\u2019d read John\u2019s emails to his girlfriends. Much funnier.","1628":"Neither. They were ...","1629":"Yes, but they were ...","1630":"No, but what about the footprints?","1631":"Oh, they\u2019re probably paw prints; could be anything, therefore nothing.","1632":"Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!","1633":"I found the footprints; they were ...","1634":"Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic ... hound.","1635":"Sorry, what?","1636":"No-no-no, sorry, what? A minute ago, footprints were boring; now they\u2019re very promising?","1637":"Vaguely. It\u2019s very hush-hush.","1638":"Ah! You\u2019ll come down, then?","1639":"No, I can\u2019t leave London at the moment. Far too busy. Don\u2019t worry \u2013 putting my best man onto it.","1640":"What are you talking about, you\u2019re busy? You don\u2019t have a case! A minute ago you were complaining ...","1641":"Okay.  Okay.","1642":"I don\u2019t need those any more. I\u2019m going to Dartmoor.","1643":"Er, sorry, so you are coming?","1644":"Oh! Looks like Mrs Hudson finally got to the wife in Doncaster.","1645":"Mmm. Wait \u2019til she finds out about the one in Islamabad.","1646":"So that must be ... yeah, it\u2019s Dewer\u2019s Hollow.","1647":"Minefield? Technically Baskerville\u2019s an army base, so I guess they\u2019ve always been keen to keep people out.","1648":"Don\u2019t be strangers, and remember ... stay away from the moor at night if you value your lives!","1649":"Yeah ... No. All right? Right. Take care. Bye.","1650":"Mind if I join you?","1651":"You from the papers?","1652":"Maybe.","1653":"I called Henry ...","1654":"Bet?","1655":"Wait, wait. What bet?","1656":"Well, you\u2019re gonna lose your money, mate.","1657":"Yeah. I\u2019ve seen it. Only about a month ago, up at the Hollow. It was foggy, mind \u2013 couldn\u2019t make much out.","1658":"No, but ...","1659":"There.","1660":"Is that it? It\u2019s not exactly proof, is it?","1661":"Wait, wait. That\u2019s not all. People don\u2019t like going up there, you know \u2013 to the Hollow. Gives them a ... bad sort of feeling.","1662":"Nah, don\u2019t be stupid, nothing like that, but I reckon there is something out there \u2013 something from Baskerville, escaped.","1663":"Maybe. God knows what they\u2019ve been spraying on us all these years, or putting in the water. I wouldn\u2019t trust \u2019em as far as I could spit.","1664":"You\u2019ve got ID for Baskerville. How?","1665":"Brilliant.","1666":"We\u2019ll get caught.","1667":"Thank you very much, sir.","1668":"Mycroft\u2019s name literally opens doors!","1669":"What is it? Are we in trouble?","1670":"Yes, sir, sorry, sir.","1671":"Your ID showed up straight away, Mr. Holmes. Corporal Lyons, security. Is there something wrong, sir?","1672":"Yes, sir.","1673":"Haven\u2019t pulled rank in ages.","1674":"Oh yeah.","1675":"Lots, sir.","1676":"They\u2019d have to know how to use that lift, sir. We\u2019re not breeding them that clever.","1677":"Doctor Stapleton.","1678":"Really?","1679":"I\u2019m not free to say. Official secrets.","1680":"I have a lot of fingers in a lot of pies. I like to mix things up \u2013 genes, mostly; now and again actual fingers.","1681":"I doubt it.","1682":"Have you been talking to my daughter?","1683":"The rabbit?","1684":"The rabbit?","1685":"Oh, you reckon?","1686":"I have absolutely no idea what you\u2019re talking about. Who are you?","1687":"That\u2019s it?","1688":"Did we just break into a military base to investigate a rabbit?","1689":"Major Barrymore, is it?  Yes, well, good. Very good.  We\u2019re very impressed, aren\u2019t we, Mr. Holmes?","1690":"The whole point of Baskerville was to eliminate this kind of bureaucratic nonsense ...","1691":"Inspections?!","1692":"Yeah. I\u2019m getting a little slow on faces but Mr. Holmes here isn\u2019t someone I expected to show up in this place.","1693":"I had the honour of meeting Mr. Holmes at the W.H.O. conference in ...  ... Brussels, was it?","1694":"Very well, sir.","1695":"Oh, don\u2019t worry. I know who you really are. I\u2019m never off your website. Thought you\u2019d be wearing the hat, though.","1696":"I hardly recognise him without the hat!","1697":"Yes.","1698":"Here\u2019s my, er, cell number. If I could help with Henry, give me a call.","1699":"Oh, Mr. Holmes, I would love to tell you \u2013 but then, of course, I\u2019d have to kill you!","1700":"That would be tremendously ambitious of you.","1701":"Never speak ill of a colleague.","1702":"I do seem to be, don\u2019t I? .","1703":"So?","1704":"Oh, please, can we not do this, this time?","1705":"You being all mysterious with your cheekbones and turning your coat collar up so you look cool.","1706":"So, the email from Kirsty \u2013 the, er, missing luminous rabbit.","1707":"She made her daughter\u2019s rabbit glow in the dark.","1708":"So ...","1709":"Mean anything to you?","1710":"Sherlock\u2019s got a plan.","1711":"Right.","1712":"Okay ...","1713":"What?!","1714":"At night? You want me to go out there at night?","1715":"That\u2019s your plan?  Brilliant.","1716":"That\u2019s not a plan.","1717":"Sherlock ... Sherlock ...","1718":"What?","1719":"Oh, right. Bob, yeah.","1720":"He\u2019s a worrier, bless him. He\u2019s been very kind to me since I came back.","1721":"Yeah.","1722":"Well, mates are mates, aren\u2019t they? I mean, look at you and John.","1723":"We saw it. We saw it.","1724":"What? What are you talking about?","1725":"Maybe we should just look for whoever\u2019s got a big dog.","1726":"What?","1727":"What?","1728":"Just ... just a minute.  You saw what?","1729":"Let\u2019s just stick to what we know, yes? Stick to the facts.","1730":"What does that mean?","1731":"Sherlock?","1732":"Always been able to keep myself distant ...  ... divorce myself from ... feelings. But look, you see ...","1733":"You\u2019ve been pretty wired lately, you know you have. I think you\u2019ve just gone out there and got yourself a bit worked up.","1734":"It was dark and scary ...","1735":"Sher...","1736":"THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH ME!","1737":"DO YOU UNDERSTAND?","1738":"You want me to prove it, yes?","1739":"We\u2019re looking for a dog, yes, a great big dog, that\u2019s your brilliant theory. Cherchez le chien. Good, excellent, yes, where shall we start?","1740":"Yes?","1741":"Oh, Sherlock, for God\u2019s sake ...","1742":"Look at the jumper he\u2019s wearing. Hardly worn. Clearly he\u2019s uncomfortable in it. Maybe it\u2019s because of the material; more likely the hideous pattern, suggesting it\u2019s a present, probably Christmas. So he wants into his mother\u2019s good books. Why? Almost certainly money.","1743":"Well, maybe he\u2019s just not hungry.","1744":"No, small plate. Starter. He\u2019s practically licked it clean. She\u2019s nearly finished her pavlova. If she\u2019d treated him, he\u2019d have had as much as he wanted. He\u2019s hungry all right, and not well off \u2013 you can tell that by the state of his cuffs and shoes.","1745":"\u201cHow d\u2019you know she\u2019s his mother?\u201d","1746":"And why would you listen to me? I\u2019m just your friend.","1747":"Why don\u2019t you buy him a drink? I think he likes you.","1748":"Morning!","1749":"I\u2019m ... I didn\u2019t sleep very well.","1750":"Why did you say you hadn\u2019t seen anything? I mean, I only saw the hound for a minute, but...","1751":"What?","1752":"Why \u2013 what do you mean?","1753":"I don\u2019t know! I ...","1754":"Actually, I\u2019d better skip the coffee.","1755":"No.","1756":"U, M, Q, R, A, wasn\u2019t it?","1757":"Nothing.","1758":"Look, forget it. It\u2019s ... I thought I was on to something. I wasn\u2019t.","1759":"Yeah.","1760":"No.","1761":"You being funny now?","1762":"Funny doesn\u2019t suit you. I\u2019d stick to ice.","1763":"It\u2019s fine.","1764":"Yes, you said: fear. Sherlock Holmes got scared. You said.","1765":"You can\u2019t actually believe that you saw some kind of monster.","1766":"Yes. Yeah, right, good. So you\u2019ve got something to go on, then? Good luck with that.","1767":"Listen, what I said before, John. I meant it.","1768":"I don\u2019t have friends.","1769":"Right.","1770":"John? John!","1771":"Yes, all right! You don\u2019t have to overdo it.","1772":"Cheers. ... What?","1773":"Yeah?","1774":"You think it\u2019s an acronym?","1775":"Absolutely no idea but ...","1776":"Well, nice to see you too I\u2019m on holiday, would you believe?","1777":"I heard you were in the area. What are you up to? You after this Hound of Hell like on the telly?","1778":"I\u2019ve told you: I\u2019m on holiday.","1779":"Yeah, well I fancied another one.","1780":"No, look ...","1781":"That\u2019s his name.","1782":"Actually, you could be just the man we want.","1783":"Here. Didn\u2019t know if it was relevant; starting to look like it might be. That is an awful lot of meat for a vegetarian restaurant.","1784":"What\u2019s this?","1785":"You never make coffee.","1786":"There\u2019s an old mineshaft. It\u2019s not too far. It was all right there.","1787":"So, you believe him about having the dog destroyed?","1788":"So that was their dog that people saw out on the moor?","1789":"But that wasn\u2019t what you saw. That wasn\u2019t just an ordinary dog.","1790":"No.  It was immense, had burning red eyes and it was glowing, John. Its whole body was glowing.","1791":"How? Can\u2019t pull off the ID trick again.","1792":"Might not have to.","1793":"Thank you.","1794":"Right.","1795":"Okay.","1796":"In the labs; Stapleton\u2019s first.","1797":"Oh, you know I\u2019d love to. I\u2019d love to give you unlimited access to this place. Why not?","1798":"I\u2019ve never heard of anything so bizarre.","1799":"I don\u2019t know what you expect to find here anyway.","1800":"Well, then, go ahead, seek them out: the monsters, the death rays, the aliens.","1801":"Have you got any of those?","1802":"It\u2019s here. It\u2019s in here with me.","1803":"Get me out, Sherlock. You have got to get me out. The big lab: the first lab that we saw.","1804":"Now, Sherlock. Please.","1805":"I can\u2019t. It\u2019ll hear me.","1806":"Keep talking. What are you seeing?","1807":"Yes, I\u2019m here.","1808":"Did you hear that?","1809":"Stay calm, stay calm. Can you see it?","1810":"It\u2019s here.","1811":"Are you all right?","1812":"Did ... did ... did you see it? You must have!","1813":"NO IT\u2019S NOT! IT\u2019S NOT OKAY! I saw it. I was wrong!","1814":"What?","1815":"I told you: I saw the hound.","1816":"Yes.","1817":"Yeah.","1818":"What?","1819":"Drugged?","1820":"\u2019Course I can walk.","1821":"Oh. Back again? What\u2019s on your mind this time?","1822":"Murder, Doctor Stapleton. Refined, cold-blooded murder.","1823":"Okay. What do you want?","1824":"Size isn\u2019t a problem, not at all. The only limits are ethics and the law, and both those things can be ... very flexible. But not here \u2013 not at Baskerville.","1825":"Jesus!","1826":"What were you expecting to find?","1827":"Sugar?","1828":"I see. So ...","1829":"But maybe it\u2019s not a drug.","1830":"No, it has to be a drug.","1831":"But how did it get into our systems. How?","1832":"There has to be something ...","1833":"... something ... ah, something ...","1834":"... something buried deep.","1835":"What?","1836":"Oh my God. Oh my God. I am so ... I am so sorry. I am so sorry.","1837":"Yeah, I\u2019m on it.","1838":"Project HOUND. Must have read about it and stored it away. An experiment in a CIA facility in Liberty, Indiana.","1839":"I imagine so, but that\u2019d be Major Barrymore\u2019s.","1840":"Password, password, password.","1841":"He sat here when he thought it up.","1842":"You\u2019ve seen him.","1843":"Er, he\u2019s a bloody martinet, a throw-back, the sort of man they\u2019d have sent into Suez.","1844":"Good, excellent. Old-fashioned, traditionalist; not the sort that would use his children\u2019s names as a password.  He loves his job; proud of it and this is work-related, so what\u2019s at eye level?","1845":"Books.  Jane\u2019s Defence Weekly \u2013 bound copies.  Hannibal; Wellington; Rommel; Churchill\u2019s \u201cHistory of the English-Speaking Peoples\u201d \u2013 all four volumes.","1846":"Churchill \u2013 well, he\u2019s fond of Churchill.  Copy of \u201cThe Downing Street Years\u201d; one, two, three, four, five separate biographies of Thatcher.","1847":"That date? I\u2019d say Falklands veteran.","1848":"So that\u2019s the password?","1849":"Jesus.","1850":"Because of what it did to the subjects they tested it on.","1851":"So someone\u2019s been doing it again \u2013 carrying on the experiments?","1852":"No, not a thing.","1853":"Five principal scientists, twenty years ago.","1854":"Maybe our friend\u2019s somewhere in the back of the picture \u2013 someone who was old enough to be there at the time of the experiments in 1986 ...","1855":"Mmm-hmm.","1856":"Oh my God. Bob Frankland. But Bob doesn\u2019t even work on ... I mean, he\u2019s a virologist. This was chemical warfare.","1857":"Right: stay there. We\u2019ll get someone to you, okay?","1858":"He\u2019s attacked her.","1859":"Mmm.","1860":"I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry, Dad.","1861":"No, no, I know what I am!","1862":"What?","1863":"Someone needed to keep you quiet; needed to keep you as a child to reassert the dream that you\u2019d both clung on to, because you had started to remember.","1864":"No, Henry! Henry, for God\u2019s sake!","1865":"Henry, remember. \u201cLiberty In.\u201d Two words; two words a frightened little boy saw here twenty years ago.","1866":"You\u2019d started to piece things together, remember what really happened here that night. It wasn\u2019t an animal, was it, Henry?","1867":"Not a monster.","1868":"A man.","1869":"But we saw it: the hound, last night. We s... we, we, we did, we saw ...","1870":"Yeah, but there was a dog, Henry, leaving footprints, scaring witnesses, but it was nothing more than an ordinary dog. We both saw it \u2013 saw it as our drugged minds wanted us to see it. Fear and stimulus; that\u2019s how it works.","1871":"No.  No, no, no, no!","1872":"Right: he is not drugged, Sherlock, so what\u2019s that? What is it?!","1873":"Oh, Christ!","1874":"No!","1875":"It\u2019s not you! You\u2019re not here!","1876":"What?","1877":"For God\u2019s sake, kill it! Kill it!","1878":"No, no, no!","1879":"Twenty years! Twenty years of my life making no sense! Why didn\u2019t you just kill me?!","1880":"Because dead men get listened to. He needed to do more than kill you. He had to discredit every word you ever said about your father, and he had the means right at his feet \u2013 a chemical minefield, pressure pads in the ground dosing you up every time that you came back here.","1881":"Murder weapon and scene of the crime all at once.","1882":"Sherlock ...","1883":"Timing. .","1884":"He found something out, didn\u2019t he, and that\u2019s why you\u2019d killed him \u2013 because he was right, and he\u2019d found you right in the middle of an experiment.","1885":"Frankland!","1886":"Come on, keep up!","1887":"Mmm. Thanks, Billy.","1888":"Obviously. Suppose they just couldn\u2019t bring themselves to do it.","1889":"No you don\u2019t.","1890":"Sentiment!","1891":"Listen: what happened to me in the lab?","1892":"I mean, I hadn\u2019t been to the Hollow, so how come I heard those things in there? Fear and stimulus, you said.","1893":"You were convinced it was in the sugar.","1894":"Oh God. It was you. You locked me in that bloody lab.","1895":"An experiment?!","1896":"I was terrified, Sherlock. I was scared to death.","1897":"I thought that the drug was in the sugar, so I put the sugar in your coffee, then I arranged everything with Major Barrymore.","1898":"It\u2019s in here with me.","1899":"All right. Keep talking. I\u2019ll find you.","1900":"I can\u2019t, it\u2019ll hear me.","1901":"I don\u2019t know, but I can hear it now.","1902":"Well, I knew what effect it had had on a superior mind, so I needed to try it on an average one.","1903":"But it wasn\u2019t in the sugar.","1904":"So you got it wrong.","1905":"Mmm. You were wrong. It wasn\u2019t in the sugar. You got it wrong.","1906":"Any long-term effects?","1907":"Where\u2019re you going?","1908":"A small token of our gratitude.","1909":"He means thank you.","1910":"Just say it.","1911":"Back together with my family after my terrifying ordeal; and we have one person to thank for my deliverance \u2013 Sherlock Holmes.","1912":"Sarcasm.","1913":"We all chipped in.","1914":"\u201dBoffin Sherlock solves another\u201d with the strapline: \u201dHero \u2019Tec cracks \u2018unsolvable\u2019 case\u201d.).","1915":"Everybody gets one.","1916":"Tabloid nickname: \u2018SuBo\u2019; \u2018Nasty Nick\u2019. Shouldn\u2019t worry \u2013 I\u2019ll probably get one soon.","1917":"Page five, column six, first sentence.","1918":"\u201cBachelor John Watson\u201d?","1919":"\u201cBachelor\u201d? What the hell are they implying?","1920":"It\u2019s a deerstalker.  \u201cFrequently seen in the company of bachelor John Watson ...\u201d","1921":"\u201c... confirmed bachelor John Watson\u201d!","1922":"Okay, this is too much. We need to be more careful.","1923":"It\u2019s got flaps ... ear flaps. It\u2019s an ear hat, John.","1924":"I mean this isn\u2019t a deerstalker now; it\u2019s a Sherlock Holmes hat. I mean that you\u2019re not exactly a private detective any more.  You\u2019re this far from famous.","1925":"It\u2019d better pass. The press will turn, Sherlock. They always turn, and they\u2019ll turn on you.","1926":"What?","1927":"Yes.","1928":"It\u2019s your phone.","1929":"So, did you just talk to him for a really long time?","1930":"Oh. Henry Fishgard never committed suicide.","1931":"Pressing case, is it?","1932":"Here.","1933":"Sherlock ...","1934":"That glass is tougher than anything.","1935":"Not tougher than crystallised carbon. He used a diamond.","1936":"Ready?","1937":"Remember ...","1938":"Remember ...","1939":"Remember what they told you: don\u2019t try to be clever ...","1940":"... and please, just keep it simple and brief.","1941":"\u2018Intelligent\u2019, fine; let\u2019s give \u2018smart-arse\u2019 a wide berth.","1942":"You\u2019re him.","1943":"I\u2019m a big fan.","1944":"I read your cases; follow them all.  Sign my shirt, would you?","1945":"Oh?","1946":"Uh-huh. What\u2019s Type B?","1947":"Guess which one I am.","1948":"Really?","1949":"No. You\u2019re not a fan at all.","1950":"That all?","1951":"Bit of a giveaway.","1952":"The smudge is deliberate, to see if I\u2019m as good as they say I am.","1953":"Hmm!","1954":"Wow, I\u2019m liking you!","1955":"Kitty ...  ... Riley. Pleased to meet you.","1956":"... someone to set the record straight.","1957":"I\u2019m smart, and you can trust me, totally.","1958":"Smart, okay: investigative journalist. Good. Well, look at me and tell me what you see.","1959":"If you\u2019re that skilful, you don\u2019t need an interview. You can just read what you need.","1960":"No? Okay, my turn.","1961":"I look at you and I see someone who\u2019s still waiting for their first big scoop so that their editor will notice them. You\u2019re wearing an expensive skirt but it\u2019s been re-hemmed twice; only posh skirt you\u2019ve got. And your nails: you can\u2019t afford to do them that often. I see someone who\u2019s hungry. I don\u2019t see smart, and I definitely don\u2019t see trustworthy, but I\u2019ll give you a quote if you like \u2013 three little words.","1962":"A \u201cconsulting criminal\u201d.","1963":"Your words. Can you expand on that answer?","1964":"A tradesman?","1965":"But not the sort who\u2019d fix your heating.","1966":"Would you describe him as ...","1967":"What?","1968":"Mr. Holmes.","1969":"How would you describe this man \u2013 his character?","1970":"And how long ...","1971":"Mr. Holmes.","1972":"Miss Sorrel, are you seriously claiming this man is an expert, after knowing the accused for just five minutes?","1973":"Mr. Holmes, that\u2019s a matter for the jury.","1974":"Oh, really?","1975":"One librarian; two teachers; two high-pressured jobs, probably the City.","1976":"Mr. Holmes!","1977":"Seven are married and two are having an affair \u2013 with each other, it would seem! Oh, and they\u2019ve just had tea and biscuits.","1978":"What did I say? I said, \u201cDon\u2019t get clever.\u201d","1979":"I can\u2019t just turn it on and off like a tap.","1980":"Well what?","1981":"Like you said it would be ...  ... he sat on his backside, never even stirred.","1982":"All we know is ...","1983":"Don\u2019t do that.","1984":"The look.","1985":"You\u2019re doing the look again.","1986":"Well, I can\u2019t see it, can I?","1987":"Yes, and it\u2019s doing a thing. You\u2019re doing a \u201cwe both know what\u2019s really going on here\u201d face.","1988":"No. I don\u2019t, which is why I find The Face so annoying.","1989":"If Moriarty wanted the Jewels, he\u2019d have them. If he wanted those prisoners free, they\u2019d be out on the streets. The only reason he\u2019s still in a prison cell right now is because he chose to be there.","1990":"Nevertheless, my client is offering no evidence. The defence rests.","1991":"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. James Moriarty stands accused of several counts of attempted burglary, crimes which \u2013 if he\u2019s found guilty \u2013 will elicit a very long custodial sentence; and yet his legal team has chosen to offer no evidence whatsoever to support their plea. I find myself in the unusual position of recommending a verdict wholeheartedly. You must find him guilty.","1992":"Sherlock. Are you listening? He\u2019s out. You-you know he\u2019ll be coming after you. Sher...","1993":"Most people knock.  But then you\u2019re not most people, I suppose.","1994":"May I?","1995":"You know when he was on his death bed, Bach, he heard his son at the piano playing one of his pieces. The boy stopped before he got to the end ...","1996":"Couldn\u2019t cope with an unfinished melody.","1997":"But be honest: you\u2019re just a tiny bit pleased.","1998":"You\u2019re on the side of the angels.","1999":"I got into the Tower of London; you think I can\u2019t worm my way into twelve hotel rooms?","2000":"Easy-peasy.","2001":"So how\u2019re you going to do it ...","2002":"How hard do you find it, having to say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d?","2003":"Speaking of clever, have you told your little friends yet?","2004":"Why I broke into all those places and never took anything.","2005":"But you understand.","2006":"Off you go, then.","2007":"No; I want you to prove that you know it.","2008":"Good.","2009":"Very good. Because ...?","2010":"I can open any door anywhere with a few tiny lines of computer code. No such thing as a private bank account now \u2013 they\u2019re all mine. No such thing as secrecy \u2013 I own secrecy. Nuclear codes \u2013 I could blow up NATO in alphabetical order. In a world of locked rooms, the man with the key is king; and honey, you should see me in a crown.","2011":"Suddenly, I\u2019m Mr. Sex.","2012":"I don\u2019t. I just like to watch them all competing. \u201cDaddy loves me the best!\u201d Aren\u2019t ordinary people adorable? Well, you know: you\u2019ve got John. I should get myself a live-in one.","2013":"It\u2019d be so funny.","2014":"You don\u2019t want money or power \u2013 not really.","2015":"But don\u2019t be scared. Falling\u2019s just like flying except there\u2019s a more permanent destination.","2016":"What\u2019s going on?","2017":"Miss Mackenzie, House Mistress. Go easy.","2018":"Miss Mackenzie, you\u2019re in charge of pupil welfare, yet you left this place wide open last night.  What are you: an idiot, a drunk or a criminal?","2019":"All the doors and windows were properly bolted. No-one \u2013 not even me \u2013 went into their room last night. You have to believe me!","2020":"I do. I just wanted you to speak quickly.","2021":"The intruder must have been hidden inside some place.","2022":"Show me where the brother slept.","2023":"Okay, so ...","2024":"So someone approaches the door who he doesn\u2019t recognise, an intruder. Maybe he can even see the outline of a weapon.","2025":"What would he do in the precious few seconds before they came into the room? How would he use them if not to cry out?","2026":"He\u2019d leave a sign?","2027":"Get Anderson.","2028":"Not much use. Doesn\u2019t lead us to the kidnapper.","2029":"Really?","2030":"Yes. Brilliant impression of an idiot.","2031":"He made a trail for us!","2032":"On, what, tiptoe?","2033":"Indicates anxiety; a gun held to his head.","2034":"Tells us nothing after all.","2035":"You\u2019re right, Anderson \u2013 nothing.","2036":"Having fun?","2037":"But how did he get past the CCTV? If all the doors were locked ...","2038":"But a stranger can\u2019t just walk into a school like that.","2039":"Anyone can walk in anywhere if they pick the right moment. Yesterday \u2013 end of term, parents milling around, chauffeurs, staff. What\u2019s one more stranger among that lot?","2040":"He was waiting for them. All he had to do was find a place to hide.","2041":"Oh, hello. I\u2019m just going out.","2042":"I\u2019ve got a lunch date.","2043":"What?","2044":"It\u2019s Moriarty?","2045":"Er, Jim actually wasn\u2019t even my boyfriend. We went out three times. I ended it.","2046":"Yes, and then he stole the Crown Jewels, broke into the Bank of England and organised a prison break at Pentonville. For the sake of law and order, I suggest you avoid all future attempts at a relationship, Molly.","2047":"Oil, John.","2048":"The oil in the kidnapper\u2019s footprint \u2013 it\u2019ll lead us to Moriarty.","2049":"All the chemical traces on his shoe have been preserved. The sole of the shoe is like a passport. If we\u2019re lucky we can see everything that he\u2019s been up to.","2050":"Alkaline.","2051":"Molly.","2052":"Yes.","2053":"I ... owe ... you.","2054":"Glycerol molecule.","2055":"You said, \u201cI owe you\u201d. You were muttering it while you were working.","2056":"No, sorry.","2057":"When he was ... dying, he was always cheerful; he was lovely \u2013 except when he thought no-one could see. I saw him once. He looked sad.","2058":"And don\u2019t just say you are, because I know what that means, looking sad when you think no-one can see you.","2059":"It\u2019s fine.","2060":"Nothing.  I dunno. You could probably say thank you, actually.","2061":"It\u2019s okay, I know you don\u2019t.","2062":"Sherlock.","2063":"This envelope that was in her trunk. There\u2019s another one.","2064":"Look at that. Exactly the same seal.","2065":"Uh-huh. It was there when I got back.","2066":"A little trace of breadcrumbs; hardback copy of fairy tales.","2067":"That\u2019s \u201cHansel and Gretel.\u201d What sort of kidnapper leaves clues?","2068":"The sort that likes to boast; the sort that thinks it\u2019s all a game. He sat in our flat and he said these exact words to me ...","2069":"All fairytales need a good old-fashioned villain.","2070":"The fifth substance: it\u2019s part of the tale.","2071":"What?","2072":"The glycerol molecule.","2073":"What\u2019s that?","2074":"What have you got for us?","2075":"Chalk, asphalt, brick dust, vegetation ... What the hell is this? Chocolate?","2076":"We need to narrow that down. A sweet factory with asphalt?","2077":"Brick dust?","2078":"There\u2019s thousands of building sites in London.","2079":"So have I.","2080":"Homeless network \u2013 faster than the police.  Far more relaxed about taking bribes.","2081":"John.","2082":"Rhododendron ponticum. It matches.","2083":"What?","2084":"Look in there. Quietly. Quietly.","2085":"This was alight moments ago.","2086":"They\u2019re still here.","2087":"Sweet wrappers. What\u2019s he been feeding you?","2088":"Hansel and Gretel.","2089":"What?","2090":"The papers: they\u2019re painted with mercury.","2091":"It was killing them.","2092":"But it\u2019s not enough to kill them on its own. Taken in large enough quantities, eventually it would kill them.","2093":"He didn\u2019t need to be there for the execution. Murder by remote control. He could be a thousand miles away.","2094":"The hungrier they got, the more they ate ... the faster they died.","2095":"Now, remember, she\u2019s in shock and she\u2019s just seven years old, so anything you can do to ...","2096":"Yeah. Might be helpful.","2097":"Claudette, I ...","2098":"No-no, I know it\u2019s been hard for you.","2099":"Brilliant work you did, finding those kids from just a footprint. It\u2019s really amazing.","2100":"You okay?","2101":"Thinking.","2102":"Why?","2103":"What the hell is this? Chocolate?","2104":"This is a stunning evening wear set from us here at London Taxi Shopping.","2105":"As you can see, the set comprises of a beautiful ...","2106":"The End.","2107":"Stop the cab! Stop the cab!","2108":"What was that?","2109":"Look out!","2110":"That ... it\u2019s him. It\u2019s him. Sulejmani or something. Mycroft showed me his file. He\u2019s a big Albanian gangster lives two doors down from us.","2111":"What d\u2019you mean?","2112":"He saved my life but he couldn\u2019t touch me. Why?","2113":"Four assassins living right on our doorstep. They didn\u2019t come here to kill me; they have to keep me alive.","2114":"... the others kill them before they can get it.","2115":"So what have you got that\u2019s so important?","2116":"We need to ask about the dusting.","2117":"Well, Tuesday I did your lino ...","2118":"No, in here, this room. This is where we\u2019ll find it \u2013 any break in the dust line. You can put back anything but dust.","2119":"What\u2019s he on about?","2120":"What? Cameras?  Here? I\u2019m in my nightie!","2121":"What?","2122":"But you haven\u2019t heard the question!","2123":"Sherlock ...","2124":"Yeah.","2125":"Will you come?","2126":"One photograph \u2013 that\u2019s his next move. Moriarty\u2019s game: first the scream, then a photograph of me being taken in for questioning. He wants to destroy me inch by inch.","2127":"could you please not go into full cello-jaguar voice when I\u2019m typing this late at night and wearing headphones cranked up loud? It\u2019s not good for my underwear. Kthxbai.","2128":"Give my regards to Sergeant Donovan.","2129":"Deciding?","2130":"You think?","2131":"Should have gone with him. People\u2019ll think ...","2132":"You\u2019d care if they thought you were stupid, or wrong.","2133":"Sherlock, I don\u2019t want the world believing you\u2019re ...","2134":"A fraud.","2135":"What?","2136":"No.","2137":"No I\u2019m not.","2138":"No, I know you\u2019re for real.","2139":"Funny name. German, like the fairytales.","2140":"He\u2019s not resisting.","2141":"Are you all right, sir?","2142":"Yeah. Apparently it\u2019s against the law to chin the Chief Superintendant.","2143":"Huh. No-one to bail us.","2144":"All units to two ...","2145":"Ladies and gentlemen, will you all please get on your knees?","2146":"Just-just so you\u2019re aware, the gun is his idea. I\u2019m just a ... you know ...","2147":"So what now?","2148":"Get after him, Lestrade!","2149":"The gun!","2150":"We\u2019re going to need to coordinate.","2151":"Huh?","2152":"Go to your right.","2153":"What about Mycroft? He could help us.","2154":"We\u2019re being followed. I knew we couldn\u2019t outrun the police.","2155":"Where are we going?","2156":"What?!","2157":"Tell me what you want from me.","2158":"He left it at your flat.","2159":"Moriarty.","2160":"The computer keycode.","2161":"Of course. He\u2019s selling it \u2013 the programme he used to break into the Tower. He planted it when he came around.","2162":"CID\u2019ll be camped out. Why plant it on you?","2163":"Who is he?","2164":"Too late to go on the record?","2165":"Congratulations. The truth about Sherlock Holmes.","2166":"I gave you your opportunity. I wanted to be on your side, remember? You turned me down, so ...","2167":"And then, behold, someone turns up and spills all the beans. How utterly convenient. Who is Brook?","2168":"Oh, come on, Kitty. No-one trusts the voice at the end of a telephone.","2169":"Don\u2019t you touch me! Don\u2019t you lay a finger on me!","2170":"Leave him alone!","2171":"Can he do that? Completely change his identity; make you the criminal?","2172":"Your word against his.","2173":"Sherlock?","2174":"What? Can I help?","2175":"No \u2013 on my own.","2176":"You\u2019re wrong, you know.","2177":"You do count. You\u2019ve always counted and I\u2019ve always trusted you.","2178":"Tell me what\u2019s wrong.","2179":"What do you need?","2180":"What do you need?","2181":"Got your message.","2182":"What d\u2019you mean, \u201cuse it\u201d?","2183":"And bring back Jim Moriarty again.","2184":"What did he touch?","2185":"Did he write anything down?","2186":"What happened? Is she okay?  Oh my God. Right, yes, I\u2019m coming.","2187":"Paramedics. Mrs Hudson \u2013 she\u2019s been shot.","2188":"Well, probably one of the killers you managed to attract ... Jesus. Jesus. She\u2019s dying, Sherlock. Let\u2019s go.","2189":"Busy?","2190":"You need to ...? Doesn\u2019t she mean anything to you? You once half killed a man because he laid a finger on her.","2191":"Sod this. Sod this.  You stay here if you want, on your own.","2192":"Did you almost start to wonder if I was real? Did I nearly get you?","2193":"Nobody seems to get the joke, but you do.","2194":"Attaboy.","2195":"Good. You got that too.","2196":"Beats like digits.","2197":"I told all my clients: last one to Sherlock is a sissy.","2198":"I\u2019m disappointed in you, ordinary Sherlock.","2199":"\u201cPartita number one.\u201d Thank you, Johann Sebastian Bach.","2200":"I knew you\u2019d fall for it. That\u2019s your weakness \u2013 you always want everything to be clever. Now, shall we finish the game? One final act. Glad you chose a tall building \u2013 nice way to do it.","2201":"Do it? Do \u2013 do what?","2202":"Oh, thanks, mate \u2013 thanks a lot.","2203":"Pleeeeeease?","2204":"Your friends will die if you don\u2019t.","2205":"Not just John.  Everyone.","2206":"Everyone.","2207":"You can have me arrested; you can torture me; you can do anything you like with me; but nothing\u2019s gonna prevent them from pulling the trigger. Your only three friends in the world will die ... unless ...","2208":"You\u2019ve gotta admit that\u2019s sexier.","2209":"Your death is the only thing that\u2019s gonna call off the killers. I\u2019m certainly not gonna do it.","2210":"Would you give me ... one moment, please; one moment of privacy?","2211":"What did I miss?","2212":"\u201cYou\u2019re not going to do it.\u201d So the killers can be called off, then \u2013 there\u2019s a recall code or a word or a number.","2213":"Oh!  You think you can make me stop the order? You think you can make me do that?","2214":"Sherlock, your big brother and all the King\u2019s horses couldn\u2019t make me do a thing I didn\u2019t want to.","2215":"Naah. You talk big. Naah. You\u2019re ordinary. You\u2019re ordinary \u2013 you\u2019re on the side of the angels.","2216":"Hello?","2217":"Hey, Sherlock, you okay?","2218":"No, I\u2019m coming in.","2219":"Where?","2220":"Sherlock?","2221":"Oh God.","2222":"What\u2019s going on?","2223":"Wh-what?","2224":"Why are you saying this?","2225":"Sherlock ...","2226":"Okay, shut up, Sherlock, shut up. The first time we met ... the first time we met, you knew all about my sister, right?","2227":"You could.","2228":"No. All right, stop it now.","2229":"All right.","2230":"Do what?","2231":"Leave a note when?","2232":"The Empty Hearse.","2233":"No. All right, stop it now.","2234":"No, stay exactly where you are.","2235":"All right.","2236":"Do what?","2237":"This phone call \u2013 it\u2019s ... it\u2019s my note.","2238":"Leave a note when?","2239":"That was the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever done.","2240":"Quite the busy little bee. .","2241":"And you\u2019re confident you have?","2242":"Yes. You got yourself in deep there ...  ... with Baron Maupertuis. Quite a scheme.","2243":"Anyway, you\u2019re safe now.","2244":"A small \u2018thank you\u2019 wouldn\u2019t go amiss.","2245":"In case you\u2019d forgotten, fieldwork is not my natural milieu.","2246":"I got you out. .","2247":"Well, I couldn\u2019t risk giving myself away, could I? It would have ruined everything.","2248":"Nonsense.","2249":"Listen: do you have any idea what it was like, Sherlock, going \u2018under cover\u2019, smuggling my way into their ranks like that? The noise; the people?","2250":"I didn\u2019t, but the language has a Slavic root, frequent Turkish and German loan words.  Took me a couple of hours.","2251":"I need you to give this matter your full attention, Sherlock. Is that quite clear?","2252":"Sherlock!","2253":"I will find your underground terror cell, Mycroft.","2254":"One of our men died getting this information. All the chatter, all the traffic, concurs there\u2019s going to be a terror strike on London \u2013 a big one.","2255":"John?","2256":"You haven\u2019t been in touch at all, to prepare him?","2257":"No.","2258":"\u201cWe\u201d?","2259":"Listen to me: I am not gay!","2260":"You think so? .","2261":"Why would he be? It\u2019s been two years. He\u2019s got on with his life.","2262":"What life? I\u2019ve been away.","2263":"How would I know?","2264":"He has a dinner reservation in the Marylebone Road. Nice little spot. They have a few bottles of the 2000 Saint-Emilion ... though I prefer the 2001.","2265":"You know, it is just possible that you won\u2019t be welcome.","2266":"Where\u2019s what?","2267":"Welcome back, Mr. Holmes.","2268":"Thank you ...","2269":"Sir, may I help you?","2270":"\u2019Scuse me, sir.","2271":"Sorry! I\u2019m so, so sorry!","2272":"Please, let me just go to the kitchen and, er, dry that off for you.","2273":"Finished with that, sir? Allow me to take it for you.","2274":"Madam, can I suggest you look at this menu? It\u2019s, er, completely identical.","2275":"Hi, yeah. I\u2019m looking for a bottle of champagne \u2013 a good one.","2276":"Er, it\u2019s not really my area. What do you suggest?","2277":"Mm-hmm.","2278":"... this last one on the list is a favourite of mine.","2279":"Great. I\u2019ll have that one, please. .","2280":"Well, er, surprise me.","2281":"... if you could see your way to ...","2282":"Sir, I think you\u2019ll find this vintage exceptionally to your liking.","2283":"No, sorry, not now, please.","2284":"Like a gaze from a crowd of strangers ...","2285":"No, look, seriously ...  ... could you just ...","2286":"John, what is it? What?","2287":"Well, short version ...","2288":"... Not Dead.","2289":"Bit mean, springing it on you like that, I know. Could have given you a heart attack, probably still will. But in my defence, it was very funny.","2290":"Oh no! You\u2019re ...","2291":"Oh, my God.","2292":"You died. You jumped off a roof.","2293":"You\u2019re dead!","2294":"No. I\u2019m quite sure. I checked. Excuse me.","2295":"Oh my God, oh my God. Do you have any idea what you\u2019ve done to him?","2296":"How?","2297":"Wait \u2013 before you do anything that you might regret ...","2298":"... um, one question. Just let me ask one question. Um ...","2299":"Are you really gonna keep that?!","2300":"I calculated that there were thirteen possibilities once I\u2019d invited Moriarty onto the roof.","2301":"I wanted to avoid dying if at all possible.","2302":"You know, for a genius you can be remarkably thick.","2303":"I don\u2019t care how you faked it, Sherlock. I wanna know why.","2304":"Why? Because Moriarty had to be stopped.","2305":"Oh. \u2018Why\u2019 as in ...","2306":"I\u2019ve got all night. .","2307":"Oh, he would have needed a confidant ...","2308":"But he was the only one? The only one who knew?","2309":"Couple of others. .","2310":"Who?","2311":"John.","2312":"Okay.  Okay. So just your brother, and Molly Hooper, and a hundred tramps.","2313":"No! Twenty-five at most.","2314":"Yeah.","2315":"Mary likes it.","2316":"She does.","2317":"One Word, Sherlock. That is all I would have needed. One word to let me know that you were alive.","2318":"I\u2019ve nearly been in contact so many times, but ...","2319":"What?","2320":"Why am I the only one who thinks that this is wrong \u2013 the only one reacting like a human being?!","2321":"\u201cOver-reacting.\u201d So you fake your own death ...","2322":"... and you waltz in \u2019ere large as bloody life ...","2323":"... but I\u2019m not supposed to have a problem with that, no, because Sherlock Holmes thinks it\u2019s a perfectly OKAY THING TO DO!","2324":"Oh, so it\u2019s still a secret, is it?","2325":"Yes! It\u2019s still a secret.","2326":"Swear to God! .","2327":"My help?","2328":"You have missed this. Admit it. The thrill of the chase, the blood pumping through your veins, just the two of us against the rest of the world ...","2329":"I don\u2019t understand.","2330":"Gosh. You don\u2019t know anything about human nature, do you?","2331":"I\u2019ll talk him round.","2332":"I like him.","2333":"Ooh, you bastard!","2334":"Greg!","2335":"... with an anti-terrorism bill this important, the government feels duty-bound to push through the legislation with all due expe...","2336":"Where are you?","2337":"What-what\u2019s happening? What\u2019s going on?","2338":"Do what?","2339":"Leave a note when?","2340":"Or I\u2019ll marry you.","2341":"London. It\u2019s like a great cesspool into which all kinds of criminals, agents and drifters are irresistibly drained.","2342":"Sometimes it\u2019s not a question of \u2018Who?\u2019; it\u2019s a question of \u2018Who Knows?\u2019","2343":"If this man cancels his papers ...","2344":"... I need to know.","2345":"If this woman leaves London without putting her dog into kennels, I need to know.","2346":"All very interesting, Sherlock, but the terror alert has been raised to Critical.","2347":"We have solid information. An attack is coming.","2348":"An agent gave his life to tell us that.","2349":"None of these markers of yours is behaving in any way suspiciously?  Your move.","2350":"No, Mycroft, but you have to trust me. I\u2019ll find the answer. It\u2019ll be in an odd phrase in an online blog, or an unexpected trip to the countryside, or a misplaced Lonely Hearts ad.","2351":"I\u2019ve given the Prime Minister my personal assurance you\u2019re on the case.","2352":"Oh, bugger!","2353":"Oopsie!","2354":"Don\u2019t be smart.","2355":"I am the smart one.","2356":"Both of us thought you were an idiot, Sherlock. We had nothing else to go on \u2019til we met other children.","2357":"Ghastly. What were they thinking of?","2358":"Oh yes. Friends. Of course, you go in for that sort of thing now.","2359":"If you seem slow to me, Sherlock, can you imagine what real people are like? I\u2019m living in a world of goldfish.","2360":"So?","2361":"Change the subject \u2013 now!","2362":"I can barely contain myself.","2363":"Both of you.","2364":"Why are we playing games?","2365":"Well, London\u2019s terror alert has been raised to Critical.  I\u2019m just passing the time. Let\u2019s do deductions.","2366":"I\u2019m busy.","2367":"I always win.","2368":"Damn.","2369":"Why would he be isolated?","2370":"Obviously.","2371":"No \u2013 he\u2019s recently had his hair cut. You can see the little hairs adhering to the perspiration stains on the inside.","2372":"Balance of probability.","2373":"Stains show he\u2019s out of condition, and he\u2019s sentimental because the hat has been repaired three, four ...","2374":"The earlier patches are extensively sun-bleached, so he\u2019s worn it abroad \u2013 in Peru.","2375":"This is a chullo \u2013 the classic headgear of the Andes. It\u2019s made of alpaca.","2376":"No?","2377":"I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a crying need for that.","2378":"The bobble on the left side has been badly chewed, which shows he\u2019s a man of a nervous disposition but ...","2379":"Precisely.","2380":"Brief sniff of the offending bobble tells us everything we need to know about the state of his breath.","2381":"Elementary.","2382":"I don\u2019t see it.","2383":"Where?","2384":"Tell me.","2385":"Tell me.","2386":"Not at all. Maybe he just doesn\u2019t mind being different. He doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be isolated.","2387":"I\u2019m sorry?","2388":"He\u2019s different \u2013 so what? Why would he mind? You\u2019re quite right.","2389":"... I\u2019m not lonely, Sherlock.","2390":"Yes. Back to work if you don\u2019t mind. Good morning.","2391":"Sherlock.","2392":"Talk to John.","2393":"What did he say?","2394":"You wanted to see me?","2395":"Yes.","2396":"Yes?","2397":"Would you ...","2398":"... have dinner?","2399":"Absolutely nothing to be ashamed of, Mrs Reeves. It\u2019s very common ...  ... but I\u2019m recommending a course of ...","2400":"... monkey glands.","2401":"Are you sure about this?","2402":"Should I be making notes?","2403":"It\u2019s just that that\u2019s what John says he does, so if I\u2019m being John ...","2404":"Well, absolutely no-one should have been able to empty that bank account other than myself and Helen.","2405":"Because I\u2019ve always had total faith in her.","2406":"Mr. Blake, hi.","2407":"And your pen pal\u2019s emails just stopped, did they?","2408":"And you really thought he was the one, didn\u2019t you? The love of your life?","2409":"What?!","2410":"Breaks it off, breaks her heart. She swears off relationships, stays at home \u2013 he still has her wage coming in.","2411":"This one\u2019s got us all baffled.","2412":"You\u2019re on to something, aren\u2019t you?","2413":"Mm, maybe.","2414":"What?","2415":"This gonna be your new arrangement, is it?","2416":"Right. So, John?","2417":"Trains?","2418":"Ooh, sorry, did you want to be ...?","2419":"Er, no, please. Be my guest.","2420":"This skeleton \u2013 it\u2019s ... it can\u2019t be any more than ...","2421":"Wow!","2422":"\u201cHow I Did It\u201d by Jack the Ripper?!","2423":"It\u2019s impossible!","2424":"Welcome to my world.","2425":"Get out.","2426":"No, please \u2013 insult away!","2427":"So the whole thing was a fake.","2428":"Looked so promising.","2429":"Why would someone go to all that trouble?","2430":"Oh. Thanks for hanging on to it.","2431":"No problem.","2432":"My girlfriend\u2019s a big fan of yours.","2433":"Girlfriend?!","2434":"I like trains.","2435":"They\u2019re cars, not carriages. It\u2019s a legacy of the early American involvement in the Tube system.","2436":"There\u2019s a safety mechanism that prevents the doors from opening in transit. But there\u2019s something else. The driver of that train hasn\u2019t been to work since. According to his flatmate, he\u2019s on holiday. Came into some money.","2437":"Hmm?","2438":"There\u2019s nowhere he could go. It\u2019s a straight run on the District Line between the two stations. There\u2019s no side tunnels, no maintenance tunnels \u2013 nothing on any map. Nothing. The train never stops, and the man vanishes. Good, innit?!","2439":"\u2019Scuse you.","2440":"Right.","2441":"What?","2442":"Did you get him off a murder charge?","2443":"Sherlock?","2444":"What was today about?","2445":"For what?","2446":"It\u2019s okay. It was my pleasure.","2447":"I don\u2019t mean \u201cpleasure\u201d. I mean, I didn\u2019t mind. I wanted to.","2448":"Moriarty slipped up. He made a mistake. Because the one person he thought didn\u2019t matter at all to me was the one person that mattered the most. You made it all possible.","2449":"I had a lovely day. I\u2019d love to \u2013 I just ... um ... .","2450":"We met through friends, the old-fashioned way. He\u2019s nice. We ... he\u2019s got a dog ... we-we go to the pub on weekends and he ... I\u2019ve met his mum and dad and his friends and all his family and I\u2019ve no idea why I\u2019m telling you this.","2451":"No?","2452":"Ah!","2453":"Someone sent me this. At first I thought it was just a Bible thing, you know, spam, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a skip-code.","2454":"First word, then every third. Save ... John ... Watson.","2455":"Where are we going?","2456":"St James the Less. It\u2019s a church. Twenty minutes by car.","2457":"Er, yes.","2458":"Sherlock, what are we waiting for? .","2459":"What does it mean? What are they going to do to him?","2460":"I don\u2019t know.","2461":"What does it mean?","2462":"Help!","2463":"Jump off!","2464":"Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!","2465":"Help!","2466":"John.","2467":"Larry Grayson.","2468":"Some big debate going on.","2469":"Sorry \u2013 you\u2019re busy.","2470":"Oh, were we?","2471":"No, no, if you\u2019ve got a case ...","2472":"Yeah, well, we\u2019re here \u2019til Saturday, remember.","2473":"Well, give us a ring.","2474":"Ring up more often, won\u2019t you?","2475":"Promise?","2476":"Promise.","2477":"Oh, for God...","2478":"No, it\u2019s fine. Clients?","2479":"Your parents?","2480":"Your parents?","2481":"Those were your parents?","2482":"Well ...  That is not what I ... .","2483":"... ordinary.","2484":"Did they know, too?","2485":"That you spent the last two years playing hide and seek.","2486":"Ah! So that\u2019s why they weren\u2019t at the funeral.","2487":"Mm.","2488":"Sorry.","2489":"Yeah. Wasn\u2019t working for me.","2490":"What, you didn\u2019t like it?","2491":"It\u2019s not a sentence you hear every day!","2492":"Yeah, not bad. Bit ... smoked.","2493":"Last night \u2013 who did that? And why did they target me?","2494":"Is it someone trying to get to you through me? Is it something to do with this terrorist thing you talked about?","2495":"I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t see the pattern. It\u2019s too nebulous.","2496":"\u201cGive his life\u201d?","2497":"According to Mycroft. There\u2019s an underground network planning an attack on London \u2013 that\u2019s all we know.","2498":"Rats?","2499":"I know him, don\u2019t I?","2500":"Yes!","2501":"What?","2502":"Yeah, that\u2019s ... odd. There\u2019s nowhere he could have got off?","2503":"Mm.","2504":"Intelligence must have a-a list of the most obvious ones.","2505":"Al-Qaeda; the IRA have been getting restless again \u2013 maybe they\u2019re gonna make an appearance ...","2506":"What?","2507":"What are you on about?","2508":"What do you mean?","2509":"Right. ... What?","2510":"Sometimes a deception is so audacious, so outrageous that you can\u2019t see it even when it\u2019s staring you in the face.","2511":"But that\u2019s ... I ... it\u2019s-it\u2019s impossible.","2512":"Detached it where?! You said there was nothing between those stations.","2513":"But why, though? Why detach it in the first place?","2514":"It vanishes between St James\u2019s Park and Westminster. Lord Moran vanishes. You\u2019re kidnapped and nearly burned to death at a fireworks par...","2515":"Hmm? November the ... My God.","2516":"Lord Moran \u2013 he\u2019s a peer of the realm. Normally he\u2019d sit in the House. Tonight there\u2019s an all-night sitting to vote on the new anti-terrorism Bill.","2517":"\u201cRemember, remember.\u201d","2518":"There\u2019s nothing down there, Mr. Holmes, I told you. No sidings, no ghost stations.","2519":"Look \u2013 this whole area is a big mess of old and new stuff. Charing Cross is made up of bits of older stations like Trafalgar Square, Strand ...","2520":"No, it\u2019s none of those. We\u2019ve accounted for those.","2521":"They built the platforms, even the staircases, but it all got tied up in legal disputes, so they never built the station on the surface.","2522":"So it\u2019s a bomb, then? A Tube carriage is carrying a bomb.","2523":"Right.","2524":"Calling the police.","2525":"Sherlock, this isn\u2019t a game. They need to evacuate Parliament.","2526":"And illegal.","2527":"A bit.","2528":"Coming. .","2529":"Well, that\u2019s a first!","2530":"There\u2019s nowhere else it could be.","2531":"Hang on. Sherlock?","2532":"That\u2019s ... Isn\u2019t it live?","2533":"Course, yeah Avoid the rails. Great.","2534":"You sure?","2535":"Ah. Look at that.","2536":"It\u2019s empty. There\u2019s nothing.","2537":"Isn\u2019t there?","2538":"What?","2539":"We need bomb disposal.","2540":"So what do we do?","2541":"Well, think of something.","2542":"Because you\u2019re Sherlock Holmes. You\u2019re as clever as it gets.","2543":"I wasn\u2019t in bomb disposal. I\u2019m a bloody doctor.","2544":"Can\u2019t-can\u2019t we rip the timer off, or something?","2545":"You see? You know things.","2546":"My God!","2547":"Why didn\u2019t you call the police?","2548":"Why do you never call the police?","2549":"So you can\u2019t switch the bomb off? You can\u2019t switch the bomb off and you didn\u2019t call the police.","2550":"Mind Palace.","2551":"Use your Mind Palace.","2552":"You\u2019ve salted away every fact under the sun!","2553":"Yes!","2554":"This is it.","2555":"Oh my God. .","2556":"9.","2557":"What?","2558":"I can\u2019t ... I can\u2019t do it, John. I don\u2019t know how.","2559":"What? .","2560":"No, no, no, no, no, no. This is a trick.","2561":"Another one of your bloody tricks.","2562":"You\u2019re just trying to make me say something nice.","2563":"I wanted you not to be dead.","2564":"Yeah, well, be careful what you wish for.","2565":"If I hadn\u2019t come back, you wouldn\u2019t be standing there and ...","2566":"I find it difficult, this sort of stuff.","2567":"Yes, of course I forgive you.","2568":"The criminal network Moriarty headed was vast.","2569":"Its roots were everywhere like a cancer, so we came up with a plan.","2570":"Mycroft fed Moriarty information about me.","2571":"Moriarty in turn gave us hints \u2013 just hints \u2013 as to the extent of his web. We let him go ...","2572":"... because it was important to let him believe he had the upper hand.  And then I sat back and watched Moriarty destroy my reputation bit by bit.","2573":"I had to make him believe he\u2019d beaten me, utterly defeated me, and then he\u2019d show his hand.","2574":"Your only three friends in the world will die ... unless ...","2575":"You\u2019ve gotta admit that\u2019s sexier.","2576":"But the one thing I didn\u2019t anticipate was just how far Moriarty was prepared to go. I suppose that was obvious, given our first meeting at the swimming pool \u2013 his death wish.","2577":"I knew I didn\u2019t have long. I contacted my brother; set the wheels in motion.","2578":"And then everyone got to work.","2579":"All right, stop it now.","2580":"All right.","2581":"Keep your eyes fixed on me.  Please, will you do this for me?","2582":"SHERLOCK! .","2583":"I needed to hit the airbag \u2013 which I did.","2584":"Speed was paramount.","2585":"The airbag needed to be got out of the way just as John cleared the station.","2586":"But we needed him to see a body.","2587":"That\u2019s where Molly came in.","2588":"Like figures on a weather clock, we went one way, John went the other.","2589":"Then our well-timed cyclist ...","2590":"... put John briefly out of action ...","2591":"... giving me time to switch places with the corpse on the pavement.","2592":"The rest was just window dressing.","2593":"And one final touch ...","2594":"... a squash ball under the armpit.","2595":"He\u2019s my friend. Please, let me just check ...","2596":"Molly? Molly Hooper? She was in on it?","2597":"Get out!","2598":"Clever.","2599":"And what about the sniper aiming at John?","2600":"And your homeless network?","2601":"As I explained, the whole street was closed off ...  ... like a scene from a play.","2602":"Hmm.","2603":"Not the way I\u2019d have done it.","2604":"No, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not clever, but ...","2605":"... Bit ... disappointed.","2606":"No?","2607":"Didn\u2019t you think it was intriguing? .","2608":"I just couldn\u2019t live with myself, knowing that I\u2019d driven you to ... .","2609":"No. No, and everything\u2019s okay now, isn\u2019t it?","2610":"Yeah.","2611":"You ...","2612":"... utter ...","2613":"You ...","2614":"You cock! I knew it! I knew it! You f...","2615":"I will kill you if you ever breathe a word of this ...","2616":"... to anyone. You KNEW!","2617":"You knew how to turn it off! .","2618":"What?","2619":"There\u2019s always an Off switch.","2620":"So why did you let me go through all that?","2621":"I didn\u2019t lie altogether. I\u2019ve absolutely no idea how to turn any of these silly little lights off.","2622":"And you did call the police.","2623":"I\u2019m definitely gonna kill you.","2624":"Sherlock, please. I beg of you. You can take over at the interval.","2625":"Come on. You\u2019ll have to go down. They want the story.","2626":"You will be there, Sherlock?","2627":"Wow. Yeah, hi. I\u2019m John.  Good to meet you.","2628":"Did you, er ...?","2629":"I\u2019m still waiting.","2630":"Why did they try and kill me? If they knew you were on to them, why go after me \u2013 put me in the bonfire?","2631":"I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t like not knowing.","2632":"Unlike the nicely embellished fictions on your blog, John, real life is rarely so neat.","2633":"Don\u2019t pretend you\u2019re not enjoying this.","2634":"Being back. Being a hero again.","2635":"You\u2019d have to be an idiot not to see it. You love it.","2636":"Being Sherlock Holmes.","2637":"Sherlock, you are gonna tell me how you did it? How you jumped off that building and survived?","2638":"No, but seriously. When you were dead, I went to your grave.","2639":"I made a little speech. I actually spoke to you.","2640":"I asked you for one more miracle. I asked you to stop being dead.","2641":"I heard you.","2642":"What\u2019s going on?","2643":"What?","2644":"Really hard. Hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do.","2645":"What?!","2646":"I need anecdotes.","2647":"Didn\u2019t go to any trouble, did you?","2648":"I haven\u2019t said a word.","2649":"I thought it was you playing.","2650":"It was me playing.","2651":"You were dancing.","2652":"You what?","2653":"You\u2019re not usually awake.","2654":"Well, where d\u2019you think it came from?!","2655":"Your mother has a lot to answer for.","2656":"So \u2013 it\u2019s the big day, then!","2657":"The wedding! John and Mary getting married!","2658":"It changes people, marriage.","2659":"Well, you wouldn\u2019t understand \u2019cause you always live alone.","2660":"Marriage changes you as a person, in ways that you can\u2019t imagine.","2661":"We were going to be best friends forever, we always said that; but I hardly saw her after that.","2662":"I\u2019ve run out. .","2663":"She cried the whole day, saying, \u201cOoh, it\u2019s the end of an era.\u201d","2664":"I remember she left early. I mean, who leaves a wedding early?  So sad.","2665":"No, not really. I\u2019ve got plenty of time to ...","2666":"I really am going to have a word with your mother. .","2667":"You can if you like. She understands very little.","2668":"Right, then.","2669":"Sherlock?","2670":"The famous Mr. Holmes! I\u2019m very pleased to meet you. But no sex, okay?","2671":"You don\u2019t have to look so scared. I\u2019m only messing. Bridesmaid, best man ... It\u2019s a bit traditional.","2672":"But not obligatory.","2673":"If that\u2019s the sort of thing you\u2019re looking for ...  ... the man over there in blue is your best bet. Recently divorced doctor with a ginger cat ...  ... a barn conversion ...  ... and a history of erectile dysfunction.","2674":"Yeah, maybe not.","2675":"So, what exactly are my duties as an usher?","2676":"Sorry, what?","2677":"A-ages ago. We\u2019re j... we\u2019re just good friends now.","2678":"Is that a fact?","2679":"You can\u2019t assume from that I\u2019ve still got some kind of interest in Mary.","2680":"You volunteered to be a shoulder to cry on on no less than three separate occasions. Do you have anything to say in your defence?","2681":"I think from now on we\u2019ll downgrade you to \u2018casual acquaintance\u2019. No more than three planned social encounters a year, and always in John\u2019s presence.","2682":"They\u2019re right about you. You\u2019re a bloody psychopath.","2683":"Thanks for coming, thank you.","2684":"He\u2019s really come out of his shell. I don\u2019t know how you did it.","2685":"Um ...","2686":"No.","2687":"No.","2688":"What for?","2689":"Why?","2690":"You\u2019re a detective.","2691":"Have you solved any murders?","2692":"Can I see?","2693":"What\u2019s all the stuff in his eye?","2694":"Cool!","2695":"He said you had some pictures for him, as a treat.","2696":"Beheadings.","2697":"He\u2019s nice.","2698":"Okay, done there. What about his friend?","2699":"Seriously?","2700":"Can I keep you?","2701":"He came!","2702":"Uh-huh.","2703":"He mentions him all the time to me. He never shuts up about him.","2704":"Urgh. I chose this wine. It\u2019s bloody awful.","2705":"Oh, way out in the middle of nowhere. You wouldn\u2019t know it.","2706":"Well, he\u2019s almost a recluse \u2013 you know, since ...","2707":"I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d show up at all. John says he\u2019s the most unsociable man he\u2019s ever met.","2708":"Mm.","2709":"Oh, Sherlock! Neither of us were the first, you know.","2710":"Yes, what, Sherlock?","2711":"Filing.","2712":"What do you want?","2713":"\u201cAnswer\u201d?","2714":"Oh, Lord.","2715":"Today. It\u2019s today, isn\u2019t it? No, Sherlock, I will not be coming to the \u201cnight do\u201d, as you so poetically put it.","2716":"... delighted not to have me hanging around.","2717":"So, this is it, then. The big day.  I suppose I\u2019ll be seeing a lot more of you from now on.","2718":"Just like old times.","2719":"Well, it\u2019s the end of an era, isn\u2019t it? John and Mary \u2013 domestic bliss.","2720":"No, no, no \u2013 I prefer to think of it as the beginning of a new chapter.","2721":"Nothing!","2722":"Well, I\u2019d better let you get back to it. You have a big speech, or something, don\u2019t you?","2723":"Cake, karaoke ... mingling.","2724":"This is what people do, Sherlock \u2013 they get married. I warned you: don\u2019t get involved.","2725":"No. .","2726":"Absolutely!","2727":"I believe you Really, I do Have a lovely day, and do give the happy couple my best.","2728":"Oh, by the way, Sherlock \u2013 do you remember Redbeard?","2729":"Pray silence for the best man.","2730":"Ladies and gentlemen, family and friends ... and ... erm ... others.","2731":"Er ... w...","2732":"Telegrams. .","2733":"Right, um ...","2734":"First things first. Telegrams.","2735":"Well, they\u2019re not actually telegrams. We just call them telegrams. I don\u2019t know why. Wedding tradition.","2736":"... because we don\u2019t have enough of that already, apparently.","2737":"Ahh!","2738":"\u201cTo John and Mary. All good wishes for your special day. With love and many big ...  ... big squishy cuddles, from Stella and Ted.\u201d","2739":"Yeah?","2740":"\u201c... poppet ...\u201d","2741":"\u201c... Oodles of love and heaps of good wishes from CAM.\u201d","2742":"Hey. Hmm?","2743":"Um, \u201cspecial day\u201d ...  ... \u201cvery special day\u201d ...  ... \u201clove\u201d ... \u201clove\u201d ... \u201clove\u201d ... \u201clove\u201d ... \u201clo...\u201d bit of a theme \u2013 you get the gist. People are basically fond.","2744":"John Watson.  My friend, John Watson.  John.","2745":"Sherlock?","2746":"Er, it was Mrs Hudson laughing.","2747":"Yeah. Well, it was laughter.","2748":"Busy?","2749":"Mm-hmm. Mind if I interrupt?","2750":"Er, be my guest.","2751":"So. The big question.","2752":"The best man.","2753":"What do you think?","2754":"Sorry, what?","2755":"Billy Kincaid, the Camden Garrotter. Best man I ever knew. Vast contributions to charity, never disclosed.","2756":"Personally managed to save three hospitals from closure and ran the best and safest children\u2019s homes in north England.","2757":"For my wedding! For me. I need a best man.","2758":"Maybe not a garrotter.","2759":"Who?","2760":"It\u2019s Greg. And he\u2019s not my best friend.","2761":"No, it is! It is, and I want to be up there with the two people that I love and care about most in the world.","2762":"Mary Morstan ...","2763":"... you.","2764":"I confess at first I didn\u2019t realise he was asking me. When finally I understood, I expressed to him that I was both flattered and ... surprised.","2765":"Sherlock.","2766":"I nonetheless promised that I would do my very best to accomplish a task which was \u2013 for me \u2013 as demanding and difficult as any I had ever contemplated. Additionally, I thanked him for the trust he\u2019d placed in me ...","2767":"That\u2019s getting a bit scary now.","2768":"It later transpired that I had said none of this out loud.","2769":"So, in fact ... .","2770":"Yes.","2771":"I\u2019m your ...","2772":"... man.","2773":"Well, how was that?","2774":"So you\u2019ll have to make a speech, of course.","2775":"Done that. ... Done that ... Done that bit ... Done that bit ... Done that bit ... Hmm ...","2776":"I\u2019m afraid, John, I can\u2019t congratulate you.","2777":"All emotions, and in particular love, stand opposed to the pure, cold reason I hold above all things. A wedding is, in my considered opinion, nothing short of a celebration of all that is false and specious and irrational and sentimental in this ailing and morally compromised world.","2778":"Today we honour the death-watch beetle that is the doom of our society and, in time \u2013 one feels certain \u2013 our entire species.","2779":"Please.","2780":"If I burden myself with a little help-mate during my adventures, it is not out of sentiment or caprice \u2013 it is that he has many fine qualities of his own that he has overlooked in his obsession with me.","2781":"Indeed, any reputation I have for mental acuity and sharpness comes, in truth, from the extraordinary contrast John so selflessly provides.","2782":"It is a fact, I believe, that brides tend to favour exceptionally plain bridesmaids for their big day. There is a certain analogy there, I feel.","2783":"... and contrast is, after all, God\u2019s own plan to enhance the beauty of his creation ...","2784":"... or it would be if God were not a ludicrous fantasy designed to provide a career opportunity for the family idiot.","2785":"The point I\u2019m trying to make is that I am the most unpleasant, rude, ignorant and all-round obnoxious arsehole that anyone could possibly have the misfortune to meet. .","2786":"I am dismissive of the virtuous ...","2787":"... unaware of the beautiful ...","2788":"... and uncomprehending in the face of the happy. So if I didn\u2019t understand I was being asked to be best man, it is because I never expected to be anybody\u2019s best friend.","2789":"Certainly not the best friend of the bravest and kindest and wisest human being I have ever had the good fortune of knowing.","2790":"John, I am a ridiculous man ...","2791":"... redeemed only by the warmth and constancy of your friendship. But, as I\u2019m apparently your best friend, I cannot congratulate you on your choice of companion.","2792":"Actually, now I can.","2793":"Certainly not. .","2794":"Ah, yes. Now on to some funny stories about John ...","2795":"Oh, Sherlock!","2796":"No, you didn\u2019t. Come here. .","2797":"Yeah, I know, I know.","2798":"Can you \u2013 can you wait \u2019til I sit down?","2799":"So, on to some funny stories about John.","2800":"If you could all just cheer up a bit, that would ...","2801":"... be better. On we go. So, for funny stories ...  ... one has to look no further than John\u2019s blog.","2802":"The record of our time together. Of course, he does tend to romanticise things a bit, but then, you know ...  ... he\u2019s a romantic. We\u2019ve tackled some strange cases: the Hollow Client ...","2803":"... the Poison Giant ...","2804":"Get down, John! .","2805":"What is that?","2806":"And what\u2019s in that one?","2807":"The inexplicable.","2808":"No, she\u2019s gonna do it ... No, she\u2019s leaving. She\u2019s leaving. ... Oh, she\u2019s coming back.","2809":"Hmm?","2810":"Oscillation on the pavement always means there\u2019s a love affair.","2811":"... and of course I have to mention the elephant in the room.","2812":"But we want something ... very particular for this special day, don\u2019t we?","2813":"The Bloody Guardsman.","2814":"Ah, orphan\u2019s lot. Friends \u2013 that\u2019s all I have. Lots of friends.","2815":"But the rehearsal\u2019s not for another two weeks. Just calm down.","2816":"John\u2019s cousin. Top table?","2817":"Seriously?","2818":"\u2018bogs\u2019 is a slang word for \u2018toilets\u2019.","2819":"Table four ...","2820":"Table five.","2821":"\u201cMy husband is three people.\u201d It\u2019s interesting. Says he has three distinct patterns of moles on his skin.","2822":"Identical triplets \u2013 one in half a million births. Solved it without leaving the flat. Now, serviettes.","2823":"Where\u2019d you learn to do that?","2824":"Fibbing, Sherlock.","2825":"I\u2019m not John. I can tell when you\u2019re fibbing.","2826":"You need to run him, okay? Show him it\u2019s still the good old days.","2827":"I\u2019ve smelled eighteen different perfumes; I\u2019ve sampled ...  ... nine different slices of cake which all tasted identical; I like the bridesmaids in purple ...","2828":"Anything. Pick one.","2829":"A case. Your Inbox is bursting. Just ... get me out of here.","2830":"Please, Sherlock, for me.","2831":"Don\u2019t you worry about a thing. I\u2019ll get you out of this.","2832":"\u201cDon\u2019t want to mention it to the major, but it\u2019s really preying on my mind.\u201d","2833":"Let\u2019s go and investigate. Please?","2834":"Forty enlisted men and officers.","2835":"Now you\u2019re talking.","2836":"Er, we\u2019re just going to ... I need, um, Sherlock to help me choose some, er, socks.","2837":"Exactly \u2013 to go with my ...","2838":"Yes!","2839":"You said you\u2019d find him a case!","2840":"Come on, Sherlock.","2841":"Coming.","2842":"He\u2019s on duty right now, sir ...  ... but I\u2019ll certainly let him know when he\u2019s free.","2843":"Another hour.","2844":"Classes?","2845":"Bum itch.","2846":"Oh!","2847":"Who?","2848":"\u201cPrevious commander\u201d.","2849":"\u201cPrevious\u201d suggests that I currently have a commander.","2850":"Which I don\u2019t.","2851":"Not to everyone. He led a team of crows into battle.","2852":"New recruits. It\u2019s standard procedure; break the new boys in \u2013 but it went wrong. They all died; he was the only survivor. The press and the families gave him hell. He gets more death threats than you.","2853":"Why have you suddenly taken an interest in another human being?","2854":"I\u2019m ... chatting.","2855":"Changing the subject completely ...  ... you know it won\u2019t alter anything, right, me and Mary, getting married? We\u2019ll still be doing all this.","2856":"If you were worrying.","2857":"Don\u2019t be ...","2858":"What?","2859":"You obviously stabbed him before he got into the shower.","2860":"No?!","2861":"You must have climbed over the top.","2862":"Suicide?","2863":"Hmm. There is a wound to the abdomen \u2013 incredibly fine.","2864":"Sherlock.","2865":"Oh my God.","2866":"Give me your scarf.","2867":"Nurse, press here \u2013 hard.","2868":"Stephen. Stephen, stay with me.","2869":"Private Bainbridge had just come off guard duty. He\u2019d stood there for hours, plenty of people watching, nothing apparently wrong. He came off duty and within minutes was nearly dead from a wound in his stomach, but there was no weapon. Where did it go? Ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to consider this: a murderer who can walk through walls, a weapon that can vanish \u2013 but in all of this there is only one element which can be said to be truly remarkable. Would anyone like to make a guess?","2870":"Come on, come on, there is actually an element of Q and A to all of this.","2871":"Scotland Yard.","2872":"Have you got a theory?","2873":"Er, um, if the, uh, if the, if-if-if, if the blade was, er, propelled through the, um ...  ... grating in the air vent ... maybe a-a ballister or a \u2013 or a \u2013 or a catapult. Erm, somebody tiny could-could crawl in there.  So, yeah, we\u2019re loo... we\u2019re looking for a-a-a-a dwarf.","2874":"Really?","2875":"No.","2876":"He stabbed himself.","2877":"Hello? Who was that?","2878":"Tom.","2879":"Um ... attempted suicide, with a blade made of compacted blood and bone; broke after piercing his abdomen ... like a meat ... dagger.","2880":"Sit. Down.","2881":"No.","2882":"There was one feature, and only one feature, of interest in the whole of this baffling case, and quite frankly it was the usual. John Watson \u2013 who, while I was trying to solve the murder, instead saved a life.","2883":"There are mysteries worth solving and stories worth telling.","2884":"The best and bravest man I know \u2013 and on top of that he actually knows how to do stuff.","2885":"True!","2886":"No-no, wait, so how was it ... how was it done?","2887":"The stabbing.","2888":"I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t solve that one. That\u2019s ...  ... It can happen sometimes. It\u2019s very ... very disappointing.","2889":"Locations of ... murders?","2890":"Yeah, but why-why can\u2019t you just do Underground stations?","2891":"... every street where you found a corpse! Delightful Where do I come in?","2892":"You\u2019re a graduate chemist. Can\u2019t you just work it out?","2893":"Meaning you think I like a drink.","2894":"That I\u2019m a drunk.","2895":"No. No!","2896":"I am.","2897":"How\u2019s ... .","2898":"Not a sociopath.","2899":"And we\u2019re having quite a lot of sex.","2900":"Okay.","2901":"I want you to calculate John\u2019s ideal intake, and mine, to remain in the sweet spot the whole evening.","2902":"Urinating in wardrobes, bad.","2903":"Hmm.","2904":"Pints?","2905":"What, are we on a schedule?","2906":"Cheers.","2907":"Cheers.","2908":"What?","2909":"Hang on. Tell me after \u2013 I need the loo. .","2910":"Eh?","2911":"Nothing \u2013 go!","2912":"Sorry?","2913":"Your visit.","2914":"Cheers.","2915":"I know ash!","2916":"Stand up.","2917":"Ash. I know ash.","2918":"I have an international reputation.","2919":"No, I don\u2019t have an international reputation.","2920":"No.","2921":"And I can\u2019t even remember what for.","2922":"Ooh! What are you doing back? I thought you were going to be out late.","2923":"Am I a vegetable?","2924":"Funny!","2925":"Come on.","2926":"It\u2019s your go.","2927":"Sometimes.","2928":"Yes, you\u2019re human.","2929":"Yep.","2930":"Not as tall as people think.","2931":"Ish.","2932":"I\u2019d say so.","2933":"You would?","2934":"To s-some people.","2935":"Er, no, they don\u2019t. You tend to rub \u2019em up the wrong way.","2936":"Okay.","2937":"Are you ...?  You know we don\u2019t have a king?","2938":"No. .","2939":"What?","2940":"Am I ... pretty?  This.","2941":"Yeah, but am I a pretty lady?","2942":"You picked the name!","2943":"You\u2019re not really getting the hang of this game, are you, Sherlock?","2944":"So I am human, I\u2019m not as tall as people think I am ...","2945":"I\u2019m-I\u2019m nice-ish ...","2946":"... clever, important to some people, but I tend to rub them up the wrong way.","2947":"Go on, then.","2948":"Hallo.","2949":"With a ghost, Mr. Holmes!","2950":"Boring, boring, boring \u2013 no!","2951":"Fascinating!","2952":"John \u2013 John!

Wake up!","2958":"... on.","2959":"See anything?","2960":"Any clues, Mr. Holmes?","2961":"Oh, errrrrr ...","2962":"I\u2019m just gonna whip this out. .","2963":"Oh, no ...","2964":"This is a famous detective. It\u2019s Sherlock Holmes and his partner, John Hamish Watson.","2965":"... crime scene!","2966":"... an evening.","2967":"I was gonna pretend, but it was, truly.","2968":"What?","2969":"That\u2019s Sherlock.","2970":"Others?","2971":"Victims, women. Most ghosts tend to haunt a single house \u2013 this ghost, however, is willing to commute, look.","2972":"Mmmmmm, not you.","2973":"Not you.","2974":"Not you.","2975":"Your humble transcriber is so anally obsessed with the accuracy of her transcripts that normally she would type every single instance of what follows, carefully counting every single \u201cNot you\u201d and the location of the woman to whom Sherlock says it. However, it would probably make for very boring reading and so for speed, convenience and the nurturing of very sore typing fingers, suffice it to say that this scene continues for a long time, with Sherlock dismissing woman after woman, each of whom sits down.","2976":"Vicky.","2977":"Online.","2978":"Told you.","2979":"Um, \u201clove_monkey.\u201d","2980":"His place.","2981":"Nothing happened. It was just ... very romantic.","2982":"Let your food go cold. Mrs Hudson\u2019ll play hell.","2983":"Sorry about that.","2984":"He had a lovely manner.","2985":"Different names, different addresses.","2986":"He had a mask on.","2987":"He\u2019s stealing the identity of corpses ...","2988":"to see the text of the articles which Sherlock looks at, together with the online article about Sholto and the newspaper articles at the beginning of the episode, click here.","2989":"All single men.

No-one wants to use a dead man\u2019s home.","2993":"Then he\u2019s gone.","2994":"He\u2019s not a ghost, John. He\u2019s a mayfly. He lives for a day.","2995":"So \u2013 what was it he was looking for?","2996":"Maid. .","2997":"Obvious. You all work for the same person!","2998":"No, not the same employer. Damn.","2999":"Come on. We can do this.","3000":"Dungeon.","3001":"Whatever\u2019s cheap.","3002":"Est\u00e9e Lauder.","3003":"George Clooney?","3004":"Two: someone who isn\u2019t constantly trying to define himself by his masculinity ...","3005":"There\u2019s a unifying factor. There has to be.","3006":"None of you reported anything stolen.","3007":"Security guard, gardener, cook, maid, private nurse. He\u2019s romancing his way up a pecking order, somebody\u2019s pecking order.","3008":"Come on, think.","3009":"Unless ...","3010":"No.","3011":"What d\u2019you mean?","3012":"See ya.","3013":"Bye-bye. .","3014":"Enjoy the wedding.","3015":"You\u2019re missing the obvious, mate.","3016":"He\u2019s a man.","3017":"Maybe he\u2019s married.","3018":"Ohh.","3019":"Married. Obvious, really. Our Mayfly Man was trying to escape the suffocating chains of domesticity ...","3020":"... and instead of endless nights in, watching the telly, or going to barbecues with awful dreadful boring people he couldn\u2019t stand, he used his wits, cleverness and powers of disguise ...  ... to play the field. He was ...","3021":"On second thoughts I probably should have told you about the Elephant in the Room. However, it does help to further illustrate how invaluable John is to me. I can read a crime scene the way he can understand a human being. I used to think that\u2019s what made me special \u2013 quite frankly, I still do. But a word to the wise: should any of you require the services of either of us, I will solve your murder, but it takes John Watson to save your life. Trust me on that \u2013 I should know. He\u2019s saved mine so many times, and in so many ways.","3022":"This blog is the story of two men and their frankly ridiculous adventures ...","3023":"... of murder, mystery and mayhem. But from now on, there\u2019s a new story \u2013 a bigger adventure.","3024":"Ladies and gentlemen, pray charge your glasses and be upstanding.","3025":"Today begin the adventures of Mary Elizabeth Watson and John Hamish Watson.","3026":"The two reasons why every single one of us is ...","3027":"What did you say?","3028":"You said, \u201cJohn Hamish Watson.\u201d You said that. You said, \u201cHamish.\u201d","3029":"This is a famous detective. It\u2019s Sherlock Holmes and his partner, John Hamish Watson.","3030":"How did you know? How did you know his middle name?  He never tells anyone. He hates it.","3031":"Yep.","3032":"Shut up.","3033":"Shut up.","3034":"Go. Away.","3035":"That\u2019s my birth certificate.","3036":"Yep.","3037":"John Hamish Watson \u2013 just if you were looking for baby names.","3038":"God knows where she is.","3039":"Out of my head. I am busy.","3040":"It\u2019s your name. It\u2019s traditional.","3041":"Enjoy the wedding.","3042":"What do we say about coincidence?","3043":"So, the balance of probability is ...?","3044":"What great lengths?","3045":"Which suggests ...?","3046":"Also suggests ...?","3047":"Clearly. But more importantly ...?","3048":"The Mayfly Man.","3049":"The Mayfly Man is ...","3050":"... here today.","3051":"Another glass, sir?","3052":"Something is going to happen \u2013 right here.","3053":"You have control of the room.","3054":"Don\u2019t lose it.","3055":"And down again.","3056":"Ladies and gentlemen, people tell you not to milk a good speech \u2013 get off early, leave \u2019em laughing. Wise advice I\u2019ll certainly try to bear in mind. But for now ...","3057":"... part two.","3058":"Part two is more action-based. I\u2019m gonna ... walk around, shake things up a bit.","3059":"Who\u2019d go to a wedding? That\u2019s the question. Who would bother to go to any lengths to get themselves to a wedding?","3060":"Well, everyone.","3061":"Something\u2019s wrong.","3062":"And John\u2019s great, too! Haven\u2019t said that enough. Barely scratched the surface. I could go on all night about the depth and complexity of his ... jumpers ...","3063":"... and he can cook. Does ... a ... thing ... thing with peas ...","3064":"... once. Might not be peas. Might not be him. But he\u2019s got a great singing voice ... or somebody does.","3065":"Ahh, too many, too many, too many, too many!","3066":"Criminal intent.","3067":"Extraordinary lengths.","3068":"All of which is suggestive of ...?","3069":"... murder.","3070":"Sorry, did I say \u2018murder\u2019? I meant to say \u2018marriage\u2019 \u2013 but, you know, they\u2019re quite similar procedures when you think about it. The participants tend to know each other, and it\u2019s over when one of them\u2019s dead.","3071":"In fairness, murder is a lot quicker, though. Janine!","3072":"What about this one? Acceptably hot?  More importantly, his girlfriend\u2019s wearing brand-new uncomfortable underwear ...  ... and hasn\u2019t bothered to pick this thread off the top of his jacket ...  ... or point out the grease smudge on the back of his neck. Currently, he\u2019s going home alone. .","3073":"Also, he\u2019s a comics and sci-fi geek. They\u2019re always tremendously grateful \u2013 really put the hours in.","3074":"Geoff, the gents.","3075":"It\u2019s Greg.","3076":"Why?","3077":"Sherlock, any chance of a \u2013 an end date for this speech? Gotta cut the cake.","3078":"Narrow. It. Down. .","3079":"No!","3080":": No!","3081":"Not you! Not you!","3082":"You.","3083":"What do I do?","3084":"Well, you\u2019ve already done it. Don\u2019t solve the murder.  Save the life.","3085":"Sorry. Off-piste a bit. Back now.  Phew!","3086":"Let\u2019s play a game.","3087":"Sherlock.","3088":"I think you\u2019re a popular choice at the moment, dear.","3089":"If someone could move Mrs Hudson\u2019s glass just slightly out of reach, that would be lovely. More importantly, who could you only kill at a wedding?","3090":"Most people you can kill any old place. As a mental exercise, I\u2019ve often planned the murder of friends and colleagues.","3091":"Now John I\u2019d poison.","3092":"Sloppy eater \u2013 dead easy. I\u2019ve given him chemicals and compounds \u2013 that way, he\u2019s never even noticed. He missed a whole Wednesday once, didn\u2019t have a clue. Lestrade\u2019s so easy to kill, it\u2019s a miracle no-one\u2019s succumbed to the temptation.  I\u2019ve got a pair of keys to my brother\u2019s house \u2013 I could easily break in there and asphyxiate him.","3093":"Ow!","3094":"So, once again, who could you only kill here?","3095":"Clearly it\u2019s a rare opportunity, so it\u2019s someone who doesn\u2019t get out much.","3096":"Someone for whom a planned social encounter known about months in advance is an exception. Has to be a unique opportunity.","3097":"And since killing someone in public is difficult ... .","3098":"... killing them in private isn\u2019t an option. Someone who lives in an inaccessible or unknown location, then.","3099":"Someone private, perhaps, obsessed with personal security.","3100":"Possibly someone under threat.","3101":"The press and the families gave him hell. He gets more death threats than you.","3102":"Ooh! A recluse, small household staff.","3103":"Maid.","3104":"I do security work.","3105":"Probably all signed confidentiality agreements.","3106":"No. .","3107":"There is another question that remains, however \u2013 a big one, a huge one: how would you do it? How would you kill someone in public?","3108":"Mr. Holmes! Mr. Holmes!","3109":"The invisible man could do it.","3110":"The invisible man with the invisible knife. The one who tried to kill the Guardsman.","3111":"Oh, not just planned. Planned and rehearsed.","3112":"Ladies and gentlemen, there will now be a short interlude.","3113":"The bride and groom.","3114":"Major Sholto\u2019s going to be be murdered. I don\u2019t know how or by whom, but it\u2019s going to happen.","3115":"\u2019Scuse me, coming through!","3116":"How can you not remember which room? You remember everything.","3117":"Two oh seven.","3118":"Major Sholto? Major Sholto!","3119":"I really wouldn\u2019t. I have a gun in my hand and a lifetime of unfortunate reflexes.","3120":"\u201cThe invisible man with the invisible knife.\u201d .","3121":"Solve it, then.","3122":"Solve it.","3123":"Solve it, and he\u2019ll open the door, like he said.","3124":"Because it matters now.","3125":"She\u2019s right.","3126":"Now, there is a man in there about to die.  \u201cThe game is on.\u201d  Solve it!","3127":"Yeah, I know.","3128":"What did you say?","3129":"My belt?","3130":"His belt, yes. Bainbridge was stabbed hours before we even saw him, but it was through his belt.","3131":"The-the belt would bind the flesh together when it was tied tight ...","3132":"... and when you took it off ...","3133":"Delayed action stabbing. All the time in the world to create an alibi.","3134":"Mr. Holmes, you and I are similar, I think.","3135":"There\u2019s a proper time to die, isn\u2019t there?","3136":"And one should embrace it when it comes \u2013 like a soldier.","3137":"I believe I am your doctor.","3138":"Ooh!","3139":"Why do we have to rehearse?","3140":"Well, you\u2019re a good teacher.","3141":"And you\u2019re a brilliant dancer.","3142":"Go on, then.","3143":"Seriously?","3144":"Ooh! Woah!","3145":"... whatever it is you are.","3146":"Well, glad to see you\u2019ve pulled, Sherlock, what with murderers running riot at my wedding.","3147":"Sherlock?  Got him for you.","3148":"Ah, the photographer. Excellent!  Thank you.","3149":"Er ...  ... what\u2019s this about? I was halfway home!","3150":"You should have driven faster.","3151":"What is? You gonna tell us?","3152":"Is the murderer in these photographs?","3153":"Sherlock? The showing-off thing: we\u2019ve discussed it before.","3154":"There is always a man at a wedding who is not in any photograph but can go anywhere, and even carry an equipment bag around with him if he likes, and you never even see his face.  You only ever see ...","3155":"What are you doing? What is this?","3156":"Jonathan Small, today\u2019s substitute wedding photographer \u2013 known to us as the Mayfly Man. His brother was one of the raw recruits killed in that incursion. Jonny sought revenge on Sholto, worked his way through Sholto\u2019s staff, found what he needed ...","3157":"... an invitation to a wedding \u2013 the one time Sholto would have to be out in public. So, he made his plan ...","3158":"... and rehearsed the murder ...","3159":"... making sure of every last detail.","3160":"Brilliant, ruthless, almost certainly a monomaniac \u2013 though, in fairness, his photographs are actually quite good.","3161":"Do you always carry handcuffs?","3162":"It\u2019s not me you should be arresting, Mr. Holmes.","3163":"I shouldn\u2019t have tried to be clever.","3164":"Yeah!","3165":"Ladies and gentlemen, just, er, one last thing before the evening begins properly. Apologies for earlier. A crisis arose and was dealt with.","3166":"More importantly, however, today we saw two people make vows. I\u2019ve never made a vow in my life, and after tonight I never will again. So, here in front of you all, my first and last vow. Mary and John: whatever it takes, whatever happens, from now on I swear I will always be there, always, for all three of you.","3167":"Er, I\u2019m sorry, I mean, I mean two of you. All two of you. Both of you, in fact. I\u2019ve just miscounted.","3168":"Anyway, it\u2019s time for dancing.  Play the music again, please, thank you.","3169":"Okay, everybody, just dance. Don\u2019t be shy!","3170":"Dancing, please!","3171":"Very good!","3172":"\u201cDeduction\u201d?","3173":"Starving.","3174":"Urgh. I chose this wine. It\u2019s bloody awful.","3175":"\u201cThe signs\u201d?","3176":"What?!","3177":"Mary, I think you should do a pregnancy test.","3178":"Just ... shut up.","3179":"How did he notice before me? I\u2019m a bloody doctor.","3180":"It\u2019s your day off!","3181":"I\u2019m pregnant \u2013 I\u2019m panicking.","3182":"Don\u2019t panic. None of you panic.","3183":"Oh, and you\u2019d know, of course?","3184":"What practice?","3185":"Yeah.","3186":"Mm?","3187":"Well, we can\u2019t all three dance. There are limits!","3188":"This isn\u2019t a waltz, is it? .","3189":"Baker Street.","3190":"Enough for a lifetime.","3191":"Oh, God, yes.","3192":"Hey, all right?","3193":"Ah, hello, John.","3194":"Didn\u2019t expect to see you here.","3195":"Who is?","3196":"A month \u2013 that\u2019s all it took. One.","3197":"Sherlock Holmes in a drug den! How\u2019s that gonna look?","3198":"No you\u2019re not!","3199":"\u201cShezza\u201d?","3200":"And how dare you betray the love of your friends? Say you\u2019re sorry.","3201":"If you were anywhere near this kind of thing again, you could have called, you could have talked to me.","3202":"A ca... What kind of case would need you doing this?","3203":"No. We\u2019re not playing this game.","3204":"Yeah, probably just an addict in need of a fix.","3205":"Is it his shirt?","3206":"... ready to pack.","3207":"... you\u2019ve only started recently, because you\u2019ve got a bit of chafing.","3208":"They call me The Wig.","3209":"Well, they-they call me Wiggy.","3210":"Bill. Bill Wiggins.","3211":"Nice observational skills, Billy.","3212":"Good news?","3213":"Oh, excellent news \u2013 the best.","3214":"There\u2019s every chance that my drug habit might hit the newspapers. The game is on.","3215":"Excuse me for a second.","3216":"Yeah. Owns some newspapers \u2013 ones I don\u2019t read.","3217":"Mary\u2019s taking the boys home; I\u2019m taking you. We did discuss it.","3218":"I noticed.","3219":"I have to filter out a lot of witless babble. I\u2019ve got Mrs Hudson on semi-permanent mute.","3220":"So I\u2019ll just pay, then, shall I?","3221":"He\u2019s straightened the knocker.","3222":"Why\u2019d you do that?","3223":"Well, then, Sherlock. Back on the sauce?","3224":"The siren call of old habits. How very like Uncle Rudy \u2013 though, in many ways, cross-dressing would have been a wiser path for you.","3225":"\u2019Course he bloody did. Now, save me a little time. Where should we be looking?","3226":"Mr. Holmes?","3227":"For God\u2019s sake!","3228":"You\u2019re a celebrity these days, Sherlock. You can\u2019t afford a drug habit.","3229":"Hey, what happened to my chair?","3230":"Well, it\u2019s good to be missed.","3231":"What have you found so far? Clearly nothing.","3232":"You haven\u2019t been home all night. So, why would a man who has never knowingly closed the door without the direct orders of his mother bother to do so on this occasion?","3233":"Okay, stop! Just stop.","3234":"Won\u2019t be the first time that your substance abuse has wreaked havoc with their line-dancing.","3235":"What case could possibly justify this?","3236":"Magnussen.","3237":"Magnussen is not your business.","3238":"You may consider him under my protection.","3239":"If you go against Magnussen, then you will find yourself going against me. .","3240":"Okay. I\u2019ll let you know if I notice.","3241":"Er, what was I going to say? Oh, yeah.","3242":"Unwise, brother mine.","3243":"Er, Magnussen?","3244":"About eight.","3245":"It\u2019s for a case, you said?","3246":"What sort of case?","3247":"You trying to put me off?","3248":"God, no.","3249":"Trying to recruit you.","3250":"Morning! Room for a little one?!","3251":"Morning.","3252":"Yyyyeah, one or two, pretty much.","3253":"You have a girlfriend?","3254":"Yes, I have.","3255":"Yes, you have.","3256":"You have a girlfriend.","3257":"Yes. Well ... yes.  But I mean you, you, you ... are in a relationship?","3258":"You and Janine?","3259":"Care to elaborate?","3260":"You got that from a book.","3261":"And you, Sherl, you\u2019re gonna have to tell me where you were last night.","3262":"\u201cWorking\u201d. Of course. I\u2019m the only one who really knows what you\u2019re like, remember?","3263":"But we should have you two over for dinner really soon!","3264":"You too.","3265":"Solve me a crime, Sherlock Holmes.","3266":"You know Magnussen as a newspaper owner, but he\u2019s so much more than that.","3267":"He uses his power and wealth to gain information. The more he acquires, the greater his wealth and power.","3268":"I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say that he knows the critical pressure point on every person of note or influence in the whole of the Western world and probably beyond. He is the Napoleon of blackmail ...","3269":"... and he has created an unassailable architecture of forbidden knowledge. Its name ...","3270":"Dinner.","3271":"Me and Mary, coming for dinner ... with ... wine and ... sitting.","3272":"Fine, talk about the house.","3273":"Oh, that was the doorbell. Couldn\u2019t you hear it?","3274":">.","3275":"Can I have a moment?","3276":"Doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not pleased to see you.","3277":"I can vouch for this man. He\u2019s a doctor. If you know who I am, then you know who he is ...","3278":"... don\u2019t you, Mr. Magnussen?","3279":"Well, it is now.","3280":"Mr. Magnussen, I have been asked to intercede with you by Lady Elizabeth Smallwood on the matter of her husband\u2019s letters.","3281":"Some time ago you ... put pressure on her concerning those letters.","3282":"She would like those letters back.","3283":"MYCROFT HOLMES.","3284":"Obviously the letters no longer have any practical use to you, so with that in mind ...","3285":"Sorry.  S-sorry. You were probably talking?","3286":"I ...","3287":"Okay.","3288":"I\u2019ve been asked to negotiate the return of those letters.","3289":"Maybe not, then.","3290":"Lady Elizabeth Smallwood. I like her.","3291":"Jesus!","3292":"Wh... There was a moment that kind of stuck in the mind, yeah.","3293":"... Okay.","3294":"So he\u2019s brought the letters to London \u2013 so no matter what he says, he\u2019s ready to make a deal. Now, Magnussen only makes a deal once he\u2019s established a person\u2019s weaknesses \u2013 the \u2018pressure point\u2019, he calls it.","3295":"So, clearly he believes I\u2019m a drug addict and no serious threat.","3296":"How-how do you know his schedule?","3297":"What\u2019s tonight? .","3298":"Yeah, I\u2019ll text you if I\u2019m available.","3299":"You are! I checked!","3300":"Why would I bring a gun?","3301":"You\u2019re just assuming I\u2019m coming along?","3302":"It\u2019s actually four pounds.","3303":"Mary and I think seven. See you later.","3304":"And breaking news now. John Garvie MP has been arrested today on charges of corruption. This follows an investigation ...","3305":"Magnussen\u2019s office is on the top floor, just below his private flat ...  ... but there are fourteen levels of security between us and him ...","3306":"Is that what we\u2019re doing?","3307":"Of course it\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.","3308":"Magnussen\u2019s private lift. It goes straight to his penthouse and office. Only he uses it ...  ... and only his key card calls the lift. Anyone else even tries, security is automatically informed.","3309":"Standard key card for the building. Nicked it yesterday. Only gets us as far as the canteen.","3310":"Here we go, then.","3311":"Get taken to a small room somewhere and your head kicked in.","3312":"It passes the time.","3313":"But if I do this ...","3314":"If you press a key card against your mobile phone for long enough, it corrupts the magnetic strip. The card stops working. It\u2019s a common problem \u2013 never put your key card with your phone.","3315":"It still doesn\u2019t work.","3316":"But it doesn\u2019t read as the wrong card now.","3317":"Huh.","3318":"Probably not.","3319":"Check if it\u2019s him or not.","3320":"There\u2019s a camera at eye height to the right of the door.","3321":"A live picture of the card user is relayed directly to Magnussen\u2019s personal staff in his office \u2013 the only people trusted to make a positive ID.","3322":"S-so how\u2019s that help us?","3323":"Human error.  I\u2019ve been shopping.","3324":"You realise you don\u2019t exactly look like Magnussen.","3325":"Hang on \u2013 was that ...? That ...!","3326":"I can\u2019t! You know I can\u2019t. Don\u2019t be silly.","3327":"Do what in front of everyone?","3328":"That was Janine.","3329":"Did you just get engaged to break into an office?","3330":"Sherlock, she loves you.","3331":"What are you gonna do?","3332":"So what will you tell her?","3333":"Well, I\u2019ll tell her that our entire relationship was a ruse to break into her boss\u2019 office. I imagine she\u2019ll want to stop seeing me at that point ...","3334":"So where did she go?","3335":"Sherlock ...","3336":"It\u2019s a blow to the head.  She\u2019s breathing. Janine?","3337":"Another in here.","3338":"Does he need help?","3339":"Ex-con.","3340":"Hey. They must still be here. .","3341":"So\u2019s Magnussen. His seat\u2019s still warm. He should be at dinner but he\u2019s still in the building.","3342":"We should call the police. .","3343":"During our own burglary?! You\u2019re really not a natural at this, are you?","3344":"No, wait, shh!","3345":"Perfume \u2013 not Janine\u2019s.","3346":"Mary wears it.","3347":"You\u2019re-you\u2019re doing this to protect him from the truth ... but is this protection he would want?","3348":"Additionally, if you\u2019re going to commit murder, you might consider changing your perfume ...","3349":"Is John with you?","3350":"Is John here? .","3351":"So, what do you do now? Kill us both?","3352":"Oh, Sherlock, if you take one more step I swear I will kill you.","3353":"No, Mrs Watson.","3354":"I\u2019m sorry, Sherlock. Truly am.","3355":"It\u2019s all well and clever having a Mind Palace, but you\u2019ve only three seconds of consciousness left to use it. So, come on \u2013 what\u2019s going to kill you?","3356":"One hole, or two?","3357":"It\u2019ll depend on the gun.","3358":"That one, I think.","3359":"If the bullet had passed through you, what would you have heard?","3360":"You didn\u2019t. Therefore ...?","3361":"Fall now.","3362":"It\u2019s the next thing that\u2019s going to kill you.","3363":"The East Wind is coming, Sherlock.  It\u2019s coming to get you.","3364":"Find it.","3365":"Hello, Redbeard. Here, boy. Come on!","3366":"Come on! It\u2019s me! It\u2019s me, come on!","3367":"Good boy! Clever boy!","3368":"Hello, Redbeard. They\u2019re putting me down too, now. It\u2019s no fun, is it?","3369":"You have to control the pain.","3370":"Control! Control! Control.","3371":"You.","3372":"Was it something I said, huh?","3373":"several moments from when Magnussen showed him the edge of the papers in his jacket pocket in 221B\u2019s living room; then Mary aiming her gun down at Magnussen in his flat before Sherlock knew who the potential killer was; then the front door to 221B. His inner vision closes in on the door and settles on it.","3374":"Nothing hits the spot like revenge for profits.","3375":"Sherlock Holmes, you are a back-stabbing, heartless, manipulative bastard.","3376":"So we\u2019re good, then!","3377":"Sussex Downs.","3378":"Aw, hurts, does it? Probably wanna restart your morphine. I might have fiddled with the taps.","3379":"Dream come true for you, this place. They actually attach the drugs to you!","3380":"You lied to me. You lied and lied.","3381":"When?!","3382":"Just once would have been nice.","3383":"You don\u2019t tell John.","3384":"So ...","3385":"... you\u2019re Mary Watson. Who are you?","3386":"Where are you?","3387":"Well, what am I looking for?","3388":"The lie \u2013 the lie of Leinster Gardens \u2013 hidden in plain sight.","3389":"Hardly anyone notices. People live here for years and never see it, but if you are what I think you are, it\u2019ll take you less than a minute.","3390":"How did you know I\u2019d come here?","3391":"I thought I was being clever.","3392":"Ohh.","3393":"What am I looking at?","3394":"No door knobs, no letter box ...","3395":"... painted windows. Twenty-three and twenty-four Leinster Gardens ...","3396":"... the empty houses.","3397":"They were demolished years ago to make way for the London Underground, a vent for the old steam trains.","3398":"Only the very front section of the house remains. It\u2019s just a fa\u00e7ade.  Remind you of anyone, Mary? A fa\u00e7ade.","3399":"Sorry. I never could resist a touch of drama.","3400":"Do you own this place?","3401":"Mmm. I won it in a card game with the Clarence House Cannibal.","3402":"Nearly cost me my kidneys, but fortunately I had a ...  ... straight flush.","3403":"What do you want, Sherlock?","3404":"Mary Morstan was stillborn in October 1972. Her gravestone is in Chiswick Cemetery where \u2013 five years ago \u2013 you acquired her name and date of birth and thereafter her identity.","3405":"That\u2019s why you don\u2019t have \u2018friends\u2019 from before that date.","3406":"Ah, orphan\u2019s lot. Friends \u2013 that\u2019s all I have. .","3407":"At first I thought it was just a Bible thing, you know, spam, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a skip-code.","3408":"How can you not remember which room? You remember everything.","3409":"You were very slow.","3410":"How badly do you want to find out?","3411":"If I die here, my body will be found in a building with your face projected on the front of it. Even Scotland Yard could get somewhere with that.","3412":"I want to know how good you are.  Go on. Show me. The doctor\u2019s wife must be a little bit bored by now.","3413":"I suppose it was a fairly obvious trick.","3414":"And yet, over a distance of six feet, you failed to make a kill shot.","3415":"Enough to hospitalise me; not enough to kill me. That wasn\u2019t a miss.","3416":"That was surgery.","3417":"What case?","3418":"... understand. There is nothing in this world that I would not do to stop that happening.","3419":"Sorry.","3420":"Not that obvious a trick.","3421":"Not absolutely sure why you\u2019re here.","3422":"I\u2019m his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Mrs. \u2019olmes. When \u2019e dies, I get all his stuff, an\u2019 \u2019is job.","3423":"Oh. Well, I help out a bit.","3424":"If \u2019e does get murdered or something ...","3425":"Those two. They all right?","3426":"Well, you know \u2013 they\u2019ve had their ups and downs.","3427":"Oh, Sherlock! Oh, good gracious, you look terrible.","3428":"I don\u2019t have any morphine!","3429":"Bloody good question.","3430":"Is everyone I\u2019ve ever met a psychopath?","3431":"Yes.","3432":"And stay shut up, because this is not funny.  Not this time.","3433":"What have I ever done ... hmm? ... my whole life ... to deserve you? .","3434":"Sherlock, I\u2019ve told you ...  ... shut up.","3435":"Sherlock, one more word and you will not need morphine.","3436":"You were a doctor who went to war.","3437":"You\u2019re a man who couldn\u2019t stay in the suburbs for more than a month without storming a crack den and beating up a junkie. Your best friend is a sociopath who solves crimes as an alternative to getting high.","3438":"That\u2019s me, by the way.  Hello. .","3439":"It was my husband\u2019s cartel. I was just typing.","3440":"Sherlock Holmes, if you\u2019ve been Youtube-ing ...","3441":"Why is she like that?","3442":"Oh, the neighbours!","3443":"My lying wife.","3444":"And the woman who\u2019s carrying my child who has lied to me since the day I met her?","3445":"Seriously? Months of silence and we\u2019re gonna do this ...  ... now?","3446":"How much d\u2019you know already?","3447":"By your skill set, you are \u2013 or were \u2013 an intelligence agent. Your accent is currently English but I suspect you are not. You\u2019re on the run from something; you\u2019ve used your skills to disappear; ...","3448":"It\u2019s what you like.","3449":"So ... Mary ...","3450":"Why would you help me?","3451":"Sor-sorry, what?","3452":"When I happened on you and Magnussen ...","3453":"... you had a problem.","3454":"Kill both of us?","3455":"The solution, of course, was simple. Kill us both and leave.","3456":"However, sentiment got the better of you.","3457":"One precisely-calculated shot to incapacitate me ...","3458":"Sherlock does say \u2018bide\u2019, though I suspect that Benedict ought to have said \u2018buy\u2019.","3459":"Of course, you couldn\u2019t shoot Magnussen.  On the night that both of us broke into the building, your own husband would become a suspect, so ...","3460":"... you calculated ... that Magnussen ... would use the fact of your involvement rather than sharing the information with the police ... as is his M.O.","3461":"... and then you left the way you came.","3462":"How did she save your life?","3463":"I phoned the ambulance.","3464":"Emergency. Which service do you require?","3465":"Did somebody call an ambulance?","3466":"... eight minutes. .","3467":"We were told there was a shooting.","3468":"There was, last week ...","3469":"... but I believe I\u2019m bleeding internally and my pulse is very erratic.","3470":"Come on, Sherlock. Come on, Sherlock.","3471":"John?","3472":"She shot you.","3473":"I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve given up on the Magnussen business.","3474":"I\u2019m still curious, though. He\u2019s hardly your usual kind of puzzle. Why do you ... hate him?","3475":"He never causes too much damage to anyone important. He\u2019s far too intelligent for that. He\u2019s a business-man, that\u2019s all, and occasionally useful to us. A necessary evil \u2013 not a dragon for you to slay.","3476":"No!","3477":"I have, by the way, a job offer I should like you to decline.","3478":"I shall pass on your regrets.","3479":"MI6 \u2013 they want to place you back into Eastern Europe. An undercover assignment that would prove fatal to you in, I think, about six months.","3480":"It\u2019s tempting ... but on balance you have more utility closer to home.","3481":"This isn\u2019t agreeing with me. I\u2019m going in.","3482":"Also, your loss would break my heart.","3483":"\u201cMerry Christmas\u201d?","3484":"Yes.  Perhaps there was something in the punch.","3485":"Mary, can you hear me?","3486":"Don\u2019t drink Mary\u2019s tea.","3487":"Did you just drug my pregnant wife?","3488":"I calculated your wife\u2019s dose meself. Won\u2019t affect the little one. I\u2019ll keep an eye on \u2019er.","3489":"What the hell have you done?","3490":"Shouldn\u2019t you be in hospital?","3491":"Is it?","3492":"In my opinion, yes.","3493":"Thank you.","3494":"I\u2019ve been thinking about you.","3495":"Really?","3496":"What makes you think I\u2019d be so careless?","3497":"Am I?","3498":"It\u2019s the dead-eye stare that gives it away.","3499":"Except it\u2019s not dead-eyed, is it?","3500":"You\u2019re reading.","3501":"Portable Appledore.  How does it work?","3502":"Built-in flash drive?  4G wireless?","3503":"You underestimate me, Mr. Holmes.","3504":"Are you making me an offer?","3505":"And what are you giving me for Christmas, Mr. Holmes?","3506":"... please tell me you haven\u2019t just gone out of your mind.","3507":"I\u2019d rather keep you guessing.","3508":"Ah.  There\u2019s our lift.","3509":"Where?","3510":"Yeah, of course I do.","3511":"But it\u2019s Christmas.","3512":"I feel the same.","3513":"Why would I bring my gun to your parents\u2019 house for Christmas dinner?!","3514":"Yes.","3515":"Where are we going?","3516":"I would offer you a drink but it\u2019s very rare and expensive.","3517":"Very hard to find a pressure point on you, Mr. Holmes.","3518":"And Sherlock\u2019s pressure point is his best friend, John Watson. John Watson\u2019s pressure point is his wife. I own John Watson\u2019s wife ...  ... I own Mycroft.  He\u2019s what I\u2019m getting for Christmas.","3519":"Forgive me, but ...  ... I already seem to have it.","3520":"It\u2019s password protected.","3521":"I enjoy it.","3522":"The secret vaults? Is that what you want?","3523":"You know, I honestly expected something good.","3524":"Mycroft has been looking for this opportunity for a long time.  He\u2019ll be a very, very proud big brother.","3525":"Sherlock?","3526":"Let him. I\u2019m sorry. .","3527":"Here we go, Mr. Holmes! .","3528":"Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, stand away from that man. Do it now.","3529":"Oh, do your research.","3530":"I\u2019m not a hero ...","3531":"... I\u2019m a high-functioning sociopath.","3532":"Man down, man down.","3533":"Oh, Christ, Sherlock.","3534":"Give my love to Mary.","3535":"Regrettably, Lady Smallwood, my brother is a murderer.","3536":"Oh ...  ... don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll keep him in trouble.","3537":"That\u2019s my girl.","3538":"Since this is likely to be the last conversation I\u2019ll have with John Watson ...","3539":"So, here we are.","3540":"Sorry?","3541":"No, we\u2019ve had a scan. We\u2019re pretty sure it\u2019s a girl.","3542":"Yeah.  Actually, I can\u2019t think of a single thing to say. .","3543":"The game is over.","3544":"What\u2019s that?","3545":"It\u2019s a story my brother told me when we were kids. The East Wind \u2013 this terrifying force that lays waste to all in its path.","3546":"Nice.","3547":"So what about you, then?  Where are you actually going now?","3548":"For how long?","3549":"And then what?","3550":"Who knows?","3551":"John, there\u2019s something ... I should say; I-I\u2019ve meant to say always and then never have. Since it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll ever meet again, I might as well say it now.","3552":"It\u2019s not.","3553":"We\u2019re not naming our daughter after you.","3554":"I think it could work.","3555":"It\u2019s your brother.","3556":"Hello, little brother. How is the exile going?","3557":"Well, I certainly hope you\u2019ve learned your lesson. As it turns out, you\u2019re needed.","3558":"As far as everyone else is concerned, going to the Prime Minister and way beyond, Charles Augustus ... Are you tweeting?!","3559":"Well, that\u2019s what it looks like.","3560":"Give me that.","3561":"What? No. Get off. What are you doing?","3562":"\u201cBack on terra firma.\u201d","3563":"\u201cFree as a bird.\u201d","3564":"Will you take this matter seriously, Sherlock?","3565":"\u201cHashtag OhWhatABeautifulMorning.\u201d","3566":"Oh, God.","3567":"Our doctor said you were clean.","3568":"You\u2019re high as a kite!","3569":"Natural high, I assure you. Totally natural. I\u2019m just ...  ...  glad to be aliiiiiive! .","3570":"Vi-Vivian.","3571":"Pardon?","3572":"Well, it\u2019s a lovely day. Go for a stroll?","3573":"Ice lolly, I suppose.","3574":"Well, really, I shouldn\u2019t ...","3575":"Yes, of course.","3576":"Do your research.","3577":"I\u2019m not a hero. I\u2019m a high functioning sociopath.","3578":"... sociopath.","3579":"... sociopath.","3580":"Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger, that\u2019s who.","3581":"No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon. You\u2019re off the hook, Mr Holmes. You\u2019re home and dry.","3582":"Obviously there\u2019s unfinished business. Moriarty.","3583":"You say he filmed that video message before he died.","3584":"Perhaps that\u2019s all there is to it.  Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.","3585":"We brought you back to deal with this. What are you going to do?","3586":"\u201cWait\u201d?!","3587":"Of course wait. I\u2019m the target. Targets wait. Look \u2013 whatever\u2019s coming, whatever he\u2019s lined up, I\u2019ll know when it begins.","3588":"Why?","3589":"Because I love it.","3590":"There was once a merchant in the famous market at Baghdad. One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise ...","3591":"... and he knew that the stranger was Death. Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles to the city of Samarra, for there he was sure Death could not find him.","3592":"But when at last he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death. \u201cVery well,\u201d said the merchant. \u201cI give in. I am yours.\u201d","3593":"\u201cBut tell me: why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?\u201d \u201cBecause,\u201d said Death, \u201cI had an appointment with you tonight \u2013 in Samarra.\u201d","3594":"So, what about Moriarty, then?","3595":"Ooh, I have a plan.","3596":"Basically your \u2018plan\u2019 is just to sit there solving crimes like you always do.","3597":"Sand.","3598":"Superficial.","3599":"Sherlock ...","3600":"It\u2019s never twins.","3601":"Sherlock ...","3602":"Bloody hell! Is that a guess?","3603":"So he\u2019s the killer? The canary trainer?","3604":"Didn\u2019t see that coming.","3605":"Sherlock, you can\u2019t go on spinning plates like this.","3606":"That\u2019s it! The place was spinning.","3607":"Yes, um ... I think so. Why?","3608":"A jellyfish?!","3609":"You can\u2019t arrest a jellyfish!","3610":"Oh God.","3611":"Fifty-nine missed calls.","3612":"Sherlock. Mary!","3613":"Don\u2019t you start.","3614":"Pull Over!","3615":"Oh.","3616":"... you, too, Sherlock?","3617":"Godfather? We\u2019d like you to be godfather.","3618":"Yeah, but there\u2019ll be cake. Will you do it?","3619":"Rosamund Mary.","3620":"Didn\u2019t you get John\u2019s text?","3621":"Please repeat the question.","3622":"As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.","3623":"To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery whereas, to me, it is an open book. Hard logic versus romantic whimsy. That is your choice. You fail to connect actions to their consequences. Now, for the last time ...  ... if you want to keep the rattle ...","3624":"... so I\u2019m under a lot of pressure to get results.","3625":"The seats?","3626":"Yes. The car seats.","3627":"Made of vinyl ... two different types of vinyl present.","3628":"Yeah. Not flash \u2013 he was a student.","3629":"Why?","3630":"There\u2019s something else.","3631":"According to this, Charlie Welsborough had already been dead for a week.","3632":"The body in the car \u2013 dead for a week.","3633":"Yes, please.","3634":"Okay.","3635":"Take all the credit.","3636":"So you take all the glory, thanks ...","3637":"... thanks all the same.  Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you? It\u2019s driving me nuts.","3638":"Anything you say, Giles.","3639":"Just kidding.","3640":"Greg.","3641":"Greg.","3642":"It\u2019s obvious, though, isn\u2019t it, what happened?","3643":"Not a clue. It\u2019s just you normally say that at this point.","3644":"Mm. Well, then ...","3645":"You\u2019re at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey his every whim.  Must feel very different.","3646":"Yes, well, you know how it is. All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.","3647":"Never a word of thanks. Can\u2019t even tell people\u2019s faces apart.","3648":"Then it\u2019s all, \u2018Ooh, aren\u2019t you clever? You\u2019re so, so clever!\u2019","3649":"You know, I think that really might be it.","3650":"Charlie\u2019s family are pretty cut up about it, as you\u2019d expect, so go easy on them, yeah?","3651":"Hey!","3652":"Oh, you\u2019d be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.  They know everything!","3653":"I\u2019m working on it.","3654":"Pig!","3655":"Ooh, the ... uh, The Ghost Driver.","3656":"People like the titles.","3657":"Give the people what they want.","3658":"Uh, some people.","3659":"Bizarre enough, though, isn\u2019t it, to be him?  I mean, it\u2019s right up your strasse.","3660":"Son.","3661":"Thank you very much for coming. We\u2019ve heard a great deal about you. If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you.","3662":"Well, I believe that I ...","3663":"Mr Holmes?","3664":"Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes. I ... I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever get over this.","3665":"No, shouldn\u2019t think so.","3666":"Now what\u2019s wrong?","3667":"Seriously? You?!","3668":"Intuitions are not to be ignored, John. They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.","3669":"Bit of a fan of Mrs T. Big hero of mine when I was getting started.","3670":"Right, yes.","3671":"What?","3672":"It\u2019s ... it\u2019s Margaret Thatcher, the first female prime minister of this country.","3673":"Right.","3674":"Mm. Leader of the government.","3675":"Right.","3676":"Why are you playing for time?","3677":"It\u2019s the gap.  Look at the gap. It\u2019s wrong. Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed ...","3678":"This whole thing\u2019s verging on OCD.","3679":"Yes, a ...","3680":"Oh, for God\u2019s sake. It got broken. What the hell has this got to do with Charlie?","3681":"What?","3682":"Look, no, we had a break-in. Some little bastard smashed it to bits. We found the remains out there in the porch.","3683":"How anybody could hate her so much, they\u2019d go to the trouble of smashing her likeness ...","3684":"I\u2019m no expert but, er, possibly her face?","3685":"Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time. I mean, if there\u2019s nothing more ..","3686":"You do?","3687":"Well, yes.","3688":"How\u2019d you notice that?","3689":"So you\u2019re saying he smashed it where he could see it.","3690":"Why?","3691":"Mr Holmes, please.","3692":"Yes.","3693":"No?","3694":"It\u2019s a Skype call.","3695":"Trick?","3696":"Could you take a photo and send it? .","3697":"There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car: one the actual passenger seat; the other a good copy. Well, good enough.","3698":"You\u2019re joking.","3699":"Surprise!","3700":"That\u2019s when it happened.","3701":"It\u2019s nothing. Probably just the altitude.","3702":"He died there and then. No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained in the driver\u2019s seat hidden until ...","3703":"Poor kid.","3704":"Really, I\u2019m so sorry. Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.","3705":"That was amazing.","3706":"The car, the kid.","3707":"What\u2019s so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?","3708":"Yeah, doesn\u2019t mean you have to pull on it.","3709":"Miss me?","3710":"Why?","3711":"I need to concentrate, and I don\u2019t want to hit you.","3712":"I met her once.","3713":"Rather arrogant, I thought.","3714":"Why am I looking at this?","3715":"Oh, I see.  Yes.  Looks very ...  ... fully functioning.","3716":"Sorry. I\u2019ve never been very good with them.","3717":"Humans.","3718":"Why on earth would he?","3719":"In the last year of his life, James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations, over seventy assorted robberies and terrorist attacks, including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea, and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias \u2013 which is still missing, by the way, in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical.","3720":"It\u2019s a pearl. Get another one.","3721":"There\u2019s something important about this.","3722":"Are you having a premonition, brother mine?","3723":"Appointment in Samarra.","3724":"The merchant who can\u2019t outrun Death. You always hated that story as a child. Less keen on predestination back then.","3725":"You wrote your own version, as I remember. Appointment in Sumatra. The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.","3726":"Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.","3727":"Of what?","3728":"I know! But then I met Sherlock.  It was so simple, the way ...","3729":"Sorry.","3730":"Now, you haven\u2019t always been in life insurance, have you? You started out in manual labour.","3731":" and superimposed above his hands are the numbers \u201c10\u00bd\u201d over the right hand and \u201c9\u00bd\u201d over the other.).","3732":"I was a carpenter, uh, like me dad.","3733":"Ah. E-cigarettes.","3734":"Not just that \u2013 ten individual e-cigarettes. Now, if you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would have invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things, but you\u2019re convinced you can give up, so you don\u2019t want to buy a pipe because that means you\u2019re not serious about quitting, so instead you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last. Anything to add, John?","3735":"Er, yeah, yeah, listening.","3736":"That is ... me. Well, it\u2019s a me-substitute.","3737":"Don\u2019t be so hard on yourself.","3738":"Yeah? It\u2019s been there since nine this morning.","3739":"What about my girlfriend?","3740":"You said I had an ex.","3741":"You\u2019ve got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name \u2018Akako.\u2019","3742":"But surely that means I wanna forget her, not that I\u2019m indifferent.","3743":"No, no. Ah, but now you\u2019ve explained it, it\u2019s dead simple, innit?","3744":"What d\u2019you mean?","3745":"Well ...","3746":"What?!","3747":"What?!","3748":"Are you serious?","3749":"Just the bras.","3750":"So. What\u2019s this all about, then?","3751":"Fun?","3752":"Uh, Sherlock ...","3753":"Uh, but, uh ...","3754":"Go!","3755":"What\u2019s wrong? I thought you\u2019d be pleased.","3756":"You don\u2019t look pleased.","3757":"This is my game face.","3758":"Yeah, well some people have that complex, don\u2019t they \u2013 an id\u00e9e fixe.  They obsess over one thing and they can\u2019t let it go.","3759":"You know who she is.","3760":"... Thatcher present at the first break-in. Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one?","3761":"What?","3762":"Blood.  Quite a bit of it, too.","3763":"Nah. .","3764":"Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.","3765":"Holborn?","3766":"Lambeth? Why?","3767":"Ah, right. Who?","3768":"Right.  You coming?","3769":"Who told you?","3770":"The right sleeve of your jacket ...  ... plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne ...","3771":"I will.","3772":"What?","3773":"How\u2019d you work all that out?","3774":"Are you just making this up?","3775":"Who\u2019s Toby?","3776":"So, how does that help us?","3777":"Toby the hacker.","3778":"What?","3779":"All right, Sherlock?","3780":"So I see.","3781":"No, exactly, so ...  ... don\u2019t wait up.  Hey, Sherlock.","3782":"But ... Mary, what are you doing here?","3783":"Better?","3784":"Hang on. Mary\u2019s better than me?","3785":"Yeah, okay.","3786":"Oh, what do you think, Sherlock? Shall we take him with us?","3787":"John.","3788":"That\u2019s hilarious.","3789":"Aww! .","3790":"Barnicot\u2019s house, then. Anyone up for a trudge?","3791":"He\u2019s not moving.","3792":"He\u2019s really not moving.","3793":"You just like this dog, don\u2019t you?","3794":"He\u2019s still not moving.","3795":"GROUP A -VE.\u2019 On they go, Toby now smelling the chemical elements of \u2018WHISKEY\u2019 as they run past a church.","3796":"They were looking for something.","3797":"Yes, but it wasn\u2019t a burglar. They came specifically for that Thatcher bust. Why?","3798":"Like hiding a tree in a forest.","3799":"Or blood in a butchers\u2019.","3800":"Never mind, Toby. Better luck next time, hm?","3801":"Not Moriarty?","3802":"Have you heard of that thing, in Germany?","3803":"\u2018Ostalgie.\u2019 People who miss the old days under the Communists. People are weird, aren\u2019t they?","3804":"According to this, there\u2019s quite a market for Cold War memorabilia \u2013 Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.  Time\u2019s a great leveller, innit? Thatcher\u2019s like \u2013 I dunno \u2013 Napoleon now.","3805":"I\u2019ve got into the records of the suppliers \u2013 Gelder & Co. Seems they\u2019re from Georgia.","3806":"... one to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.","3807":"Yeah.","3808":"Harker. And it\u2019s murder this time.","3809":"Defensive wounds on her face and hands. Throat cut \u2013 sharp blade.","3810":"Two of them this time.","3811":"And now someone\u2019s wandering about destroying \u2019em all. Makes no sense. What\u2019s the point?","3812":"Yes it is.","3813":"Well, I\u2019m still being slow over here, so if you wouldn\u2019t mind ...","3814":"I\u2019m sorry?","3815":"Yeah, until John publishes his blog.","3816":"0. Time passes \u2013 your transcriber can\u2019t be bothered to record each time change \u2013 and then, some time after 22:00 someone comes into the room adjoining the pool room, carrying a large bag. The person walks across to the Thatcher bust, picks it up and starts to stuff it into the bag but then the lights come on.","3817":"Wouldn\u2019t it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?","3818":"You were on the run; nowhere to hide your precious cargo.","3819":"Who are you?","3820":"Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.","3821":"Who?","3822":"You think you understand. You understand nothing.","3823":"Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don\u2019t we just enjoy the moment?","3824":"Let me present Interpol\u2019s number one case. Too tough for them; too boring for me.","3825":"The Black Pearl of the Borgias.","3826":"The problems of your past are your business. The problems of your future are my privilege.","3827":"I don\u2019t understand.","3828":"You do, don\u2019t you? You know the bitch. She betrayed me; betrayed us all.","3829":"Tell her she\u2019s a dead woman. She\u2019s a dead woman walking.","3830":"I\u2019m the man ... who\u2019s gonna kill your friend. Who\u2019s Sherlock Holmes?","3831":"We die.","3832":"He can\u2019t have got far. We\u2019ll have him in a bit.","3833":"Why?","3834":"there\u2019s a tatty sofa and a couple of hard plastic chairs, and a couple of desks, one of which has an open laptop and anglepoise lamp on it. A few other lights are dotted around the room but it\u2019s still quite dark in there. The person pushes back the hood of their coat and we realise that it\u2019s Mary.","3835":"Well, I\u2019ve been telling you that for ages! That was quite a text you sent me.  What\u2019s going on, Sherlock?","3836":"I was so convinced it was Moriarty, I couldn\u2019t see what was right under my nose.","3837":"Oh my God. That\u2019s a ...","3838":"I don\u2019t know. We-we all had one, but the others w...  Well, haven\u2019t you even looked at it yet?","3839":"Why?","3840":"There were four of us. Agents.","3841":"There was absolute trust between us. The memory sticks guaranteed it. We all had one, each containing aliases, our background, everything. We could never be betrayed because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.","3842":"Anyone who paid well. I mean, we were at the top of our game for years, and then it all ended. There was a coup in Georgia. The British embassy in Tbilisi was taken over; lots of hostages. We got the call to go in, get them out. There was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment.","3843":"I don\u2019t know. Just another voice on the phone, and a code word, \u201cAmmo.\u201d","3844":"That was six years ago. Feels like forever. I was the only one that made it out.","3845":"What?","3846":"Oh my God. That\u2019s Ajay. That\u2019s him. What, he\u2019s alive?","3847":"Where is he? I need to see him now!","3848":"Yeah, of course. It was our insurance. Above all, they mustn\u2019t fall into enemy hands.","3849":"I don\u2019t know!","3850":"Tbilisi was six years ago. Where\u2019s he been?","3851":"Sorry, no, no, \u2019cause we-we were family.","3852":"Well, he\u2019s just trying to find me. He survived. That\u2019s all that matters!","3853":"Why would he want to kill me?","3854":"Oh, no, no, that\u2019s insane.","3855":"I suppose I was always afraid this might happen; that something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.","3856":"God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.","3857":"No. Mary, you do. I made a vow, remember?","3858":"Sherlock the dragon slayer.","3859":"There\u2019s something I think you should read.","3860":"I hoped I wouldn\u2019t have to do this.","3861":"What are you ...?","3862":"There you go.","3863":"It\u2019s all right. It\u2019s for the best, believe me.","3864":"Agra? A city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India. It is three hundred and seventy-eight kilometres west of the state capital, Lucknow ...","3865":"Yes.","3866":"Oh, good. I love an acronym. All the best secret societies have them.","3867":"Of course I do. Go on.","3868":"Indeed? Well, that\u2019s news to me.","3869":"Is it?","3870":"Me?","3871":"AGRA were very reliable; then came the Tbilisi incident. They were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong. And that was that. We stopped using freelancers.","3872":"My initiative. Freelancers are too woolly; too messy. I don\u2019t like loose ends \u2013 not on my watch.","3873":"\u201cAMMO\u201d?","3874":"Little enough.","3875":"You don\u2019t have many favours left.","3876":"And if you can find who\u2019s after her and neutralise them, what then? You think you can go on saving her forever?","3877":"Is that sentiment talking?","3878":"Difficult to tell the difference these days.","3879":"All right. I\u2019ll see what I can do.  But remember this, brother mine: agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age. They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.","3880":"I\u2019ve got you where I want you. Give in! Give in! I will destroy you. You\u2019re completely at my mercy.","3881":"No it does not.","3882":"Master Bun. It\u2019s not a set without him. How many more times, Mr Sherlock?","3883":"What concept?","3884":"Happy families.","3885":"How the f...","3886":"How did you get in here?!","3887":"Hello.","3888":"Sure.","3889":"No, I-I-I mean how did you find me?","3890":"No, really, though, how? Every movement I made was entirely random; every new personality just on the roll of a dice!","3891":"Mary, no human action is ever truly random.  An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual can reduce the number of variables considerably.","3892":"I myself know of at least fifty-eight techniques to refine this seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.","3893":"You bastard!","3894":"\u201cThe mathematics of probability\u201d?!","3895":"\u201cFeasible variables\u201d!","3896":"All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that\u2019s all.","3897":"I will keep you safe.","3898":"But it has to be in London. It\u2019s my city; I know the turf.","3899":"Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.","3900":"I swear to you, I thought you were dead. I thought I was the only one who got out.","3901":"I swear to you, Ajay.","3902":"We were betrayed!","3903":"You betrayed us!","3904":"No! No!","3905":"Couldn\u2019t this wait until you\u2019re back?","3906":"Ammo, yes, you said.","3907":"My Latin?","3908":"I love, you love, he loves. What ...?","3909":"Ladies and gentlemen, the Aquarium will be closing in five minutes. Please make your way to the exit. Thank you.","3910":"This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.  We\u2019re like them: ghostly, living in the shadows.","3911":"Well, it depends which side you\u2019re on.  Also, we have to keep moving or we die.","3912":"It\u2019s like that old story.","3913":"You\u2019re very sure of yourself, aren\u2019t you?","3914":"There was once a merchant in a famous market in Baghdad.","3915":"... Death.","3916":"Hey.","3917":"On his way.","3918":"You were Amo?  You were the person on the phone that time?","3919":"Why does anyone do anything?","3920":"Well, it would be churlish to refuse. Worked very well for a few years. I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it. But the ambassador in Tbilisi found out. I thought I\u2019d had it.  Then she was taken hostage in that coup.  I couldn\u2019t believe my luck! That bought me a little time.","3921":"Very handy. They were always such reliable killers.","3922":"After what you did?!","3923":"I was never a field agent. I always thought I\u2019d be rather good.","3924":"Thanks.","3925":"What?","3926":"I didn\u2019t do this out of jealousy!","3927":"No? Same old drudge, day in, day out, never getting out there where all the excitement was. Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.","3928":"They\u2019ve taken up the pavement outside the Post Office there. The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.","3929":"How do you know?","3930":"Sherlock ...","3931":"Two Burmese and a tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.","3932":"Sherlock, don\u2019t.","3933":"Pets do that, or so I\u2019m told, and there\u2019s clearly no-one new in your life, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium. That probably accounts for the drink problem, too: the slight tremor in your hand ...  ... the red wine stain ghosting your top lip. So yes. I say jealousy was your motive after all \u2013 to prove how good you are ...","3934":"Well, Mrs Norbury. I must admit this is unexpected.","3935":"Vivian Norbury, who outsmarted them all. All except Sherlock Holmes.","3936":"So it would seem.  You\u2019ve seen right through me, Mr Holmes.","3937":"Surprise.","3938":"Everything\u2019s fine. It\u2019s gonna be okay.","3939":"Get an ambulance.","3940":"Hey, Sherlock.","3941":"Did I ever say?","3942":"I\u2019m sorry ... for shooting you that time. I\u2019m really sorry.","3943":"I think we\u2019re even now, okay?","3944":"The whole world has come crashing down around you. Everything\u2019s hopeless, irretrievable. I know that\u2019s what you must feel, but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.","3945":"That\u2019s not really my style.","3946":"Do?","3947":"Nothing will ever be the same again, will it?","3948":"We\u2019ll have to rally round, I expect. Do our bit.  Look after little Rosie.","3949":"Oh. You\u2019re not up to it, are you?","3950":"Yes, yes, I expect you\u2019re right.  I\u2019ll make some tea, shall I?","3951":"Yes, Sherlock?","3952":"Yes?","3953":"Norbury.","3954":"Just that.  I\u2019d be very grateful.","3955":"Oh God. Is that ...","3956":"Oh!","3957":"Hi.","3958":"It\u2019s, uh, it\u2019s from John.","3959":"I\u2019m sorry, Sherlock. He says ... Jo-John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help ...","3960":"Save him.","3961":"Just one word.","3962":"A name.","3963":"I can\u2019t remember who my father wanted to kill ...  ... and I don\u2019t know if he ever did it.","3964":"Well, you\u2019ve changed. You no longer top up your tan and your roots are showing.","3965":"Do you ever look in the mirror and want to see someone else?","3966":"I\u2019m sorry?","3967":"No. Why-why do you ask?","3968":"Are you okay?","3969":"Okay, how do you know that?","3970":"It\u2019s all here, isn\u2019t it? Look.","3971":"I don\u2019t understand.","3972":"I don\u2019t know!","3973":"Me either. Must have had a reason.  It\u2019ll come back to me.","3974":"You can\u2019t know that.","3975":"\u2019Course I can. There wasn\u2019t anything physical going on, was there?  Quite some time, in fact.","3976":"You can\u2019t tell things like that from a piece of paper.","3977":"How?","3978":"Dunno.  Just sort of ... happens, really.  It\u2019s ... like a reflex. I can\u2019t stop it.","3979":"I don\u2019t have a coat.","3980":"Who you talkin\u2019 to?","3981":"So what do you think?","3982":"My case.","3983":"Oh, it\u2019s way too weird for me. Go to the police; they\u2019re really excellent at dealing with this complicated sort of stuff. Tell them I sent you; that ought to get a reaction.","3984":"I have no-one else to turn to.","3985":"Is \u201ccup of tea\u201d code?","3986":"You\u2019re my last hope.","3987":"What\u2019s bad luck?","3988":"I always \u2019ave bad luck. It\u2019s congenital.","3989":"That\u2019s not rude. Congenital: it just means ...","3990":"Handbag!","3991":"Stop. Wait!","3992":"Your life is not your own. Keep your hands off it, do you hear me?","3993":"Sorry?  What? What are you talking about?","3994":"My skirt?","3995":"Look at the hem of it! That\u2019s what I noticed. I\u2019m ...  ... still catching up with my brain. It\u2019s terribly fast.","3996":"Those markings. Do you see them?","3997":"I came in a taxi.","3998":"Y-you never saw them.","3999":"No.","4000":"Why?","4001":"It\u2019s too heavy. You said I was your last hope and now you\u2019re going out into the night with no plan on how you\u2019re getting home ... and a gun.","4002":"Chips?","4003":"Are you going out?","4004":"Oh, you\u2019re in no state. Look at you.","4005":"What friend?","4006":"Oh!","4007":"Even when I\u2019m on the road, I still like quality food.","4008":"You see the fold in the middle? For the first few months you kept this hidden, folded inside a book.","4009":"Must have been a tightly packed shelf, going by the severity of the crease.","4010":"So obviously you were keeping it hidden from someone living in the same house at a level of intimacy where privacy could not be assumed.","4011":"Conclusion: relationship.","4012":"Not any more, though.","4013":"There\u2019s a pinprick at the top of the paper.","4014":"For the past few months it\u2019s been on open display on a wall. Conclusion: relationship is over.","4015":"The paper\u2019s been exposed to steam and a variety of cooking smells ...","4016":"Amazing.","4017":"I meant the chips.","4018":"Hm.","4019":"How did you know my kitchen was tiny?","4020":"Look at the fading pattern on the paper. It\u2019s not much but it\u2019s enough to know your kitchen window faces east. Now, kitchen noticeboards ...","4021":"By instinct we place them at eye level where there\u2019s natural light.","4022":"Now look: the sun\u2019s only struck the bottom two thirds ...  ... but the line is straight, so that means we know the paper is facing the window.","4023":"But because the top section is unaffected ...  ... we know the sunlight can only be entering the room at a steep angle.","4024":"If the sunlight was able to penetrate the room when the sun was lower in the sky ...","4025":"... then the paper would be equally faded top to bottom.","4026":"But no. It only makes it when the sun is at its zenith, so I\u2019m betting that you live in a narrow street on the ground floor.","4027":"Now, if steeply angled sunlight manages to hit eye level on the wall opposite the window, then what do we know about the room?","4028":"Big Brother is watching you!","4029":"Sex.","4030":"Sex. How did you know I wasn\u2019t ... getting any?","4031":"It\u2019s all about the blood.","4032":"How do you know he didn\u2019t notice?","4033":"Would he?","4034":"Well, that\u2019s interesting.","4035":"The way you think.","4036":"Sweetly.","4037":"I\u2019m not sweet; I\u2019m just high.","4038":"What? We just came that way.","4039":"Are we gonna walk all night?","4040":"What is?","4041":"We must be careful not to burn our bridges.","4042":"What impossible thing?","4043":"Yes: the name of the person my father wanted to kill.","4044":"What\u2019s impossible?","4045":"Or Elvis?","4046":"Okay, I got it wrong, then. It wasn\u2019t only one word; it can\u2019t have been.","4047":"Okay, well, how?","4048":"D\u2019you take cash?","4049":"Not cash, no.","4050":"\u201cTaking your own life.\u201d Interesting expression. Taking it from who? Oh, once it\u2019s over, it\u2019s not you who\u2019ll miss it.","4051":"Your own death is something that happens to everybody else.","4052":"You\u2019re not what I expected. You\u2019re ...","4053":"Nicer.","4054":" Deep down be... .","4055":"Sorry, I ...","4056":"Faith? Faith?","4057":"You\u2019re not what I expected.","4058":"Nicer.","4059":"Who?","4060":"Anyone!","4061":"Of course!","4062":"Anyone.","4063":"Anyone.","4064":"Shezza.","4065":"What were you doing in the middle of a bloody street?","4066":"Anyone.","4067":"They\u2019re always poor ...","4068":"... and lonely, and strange.","4069":"Who do we catch?","4070":"Serial killers.","4071":"What if you were rich and ...","4072":"Anyone.","4073":"What if ...","4074":"It\u2019s Sherlock!  You\u2019ve no idea what I\u2019ve been through!","4075":"\u2019e\u2019s lost it.","4076":"\u2019e\u2019s totally gone!","4077":"\u201cOnce more unto the breach, dear friends ...","4078":"\u201c... once more!","4079":"\u201cOr close the wall up ...","4080":"\u201c... with our English dead!","4081":"\u201c... set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide.","4082":"\u201cHold hard the breath and bend up every spirit ...","4083":"\u201c... to his full height!","4084":"\u201cOn, on, you noblest English ...","4085":"\u201c... whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!","4086":"\u201cAnd you, good yeoman, whose limbs were made in England, show us here the mettle of your pasture!","4087":"\u201c... which I doubt not, for there is none of you so mean and base ...","4088":"\u201c... that hath not noble lustre in your eyes!","4089":"\u201cI see you stand like greyhounds in the slips, straining upon the start!","4090":"\u201cThe game\u2019s afoot.\u201d","4091":"Oh, hello.","4092":"... they\u2019re that man on the telly, aren\u2019t they?","4093":"They\u2019re everywhere.","4094":"Don\u2019t you dare make jokes. Don\u2019t you dare. I was terrified!","4095":"Cup of tea!","4096":"Oh, for goodness\u2019 sakes.","4097":"What\u2019s the matter with you?","4098":"Oh, get over yourself. You\u2019re not my first smackhead, Sherlock Holmes.","4099":"The boys from the caf\u00e9.","4100":"Because they know you.","4101":"She\u2019s my therapist.","4102":"Uh, well, yes.","4103":"... over a week before I even thought of coming here, you knew exactly where you\u2019d need to be picked up for lunch?","4104":"How?","4105":"Never mind how. He\u2019s dying to tell us that.  I want to know why.","4106":"Because Mrs Hudson\u2019s right. I\u2019m burning up.","4107":"I\u2019m at the bottom of a pit and I\u2019m still falling and ...  ... I\u2019m never climbing out.","4108":"I need you to know, John \u2013 I need you to see that up here ...  ... I\u2019ve still got it, so when I tell you that this ...  ... is the most dangerous, the most despicable human being that I have ever encountered; when I tell you that this-this monster must be ended, please remember where you\u2019re standing, because ... you\u2019re standing exactly where I said you would be two weeks ago.","4109":"So what has all this got to do with me?","4110":"That creature, that rotting thing, is a living breathing coagulation of human evil, and if the only thing I ever do in this world is drive him out of it, then my life will not have been wasted.","4111":"Yeah, well, they\u2019re real enough, I suppose.","4112":"You lie all the time. It\u2019s like your mission.","4113":"You pretended to be dead for two years!","4114":"Listen, before I do anything, I need to know what state you\u2019re in.","4115":"No, I need a second opinion.","4116":"I need the one person who \u2013 unlike me \u2013 learned to see through your bullshit long ago.","4117":"D\u2019you hear me? I said Molly Hooper.","4118":"Yeah. About two weeks.","4119":"I don\u2019t care how.","4120":"Oh, well ...","4121":"Just tell me when to cough.","4122":"Well? How is he?","4123":"I\u2019ve seen healthier people on the slab.","4124":"Not funny.","4125":"If you keep taking what you\u2019re taking at the rate you\u2019re taking it, you\u2019ve got weeks.","4126":"For Christ\u2019s sake, Sherlock, it\u2019s not a game!","4127":"I\u2019m stressed; you\u2019re dying.","4128":"Yeah, well, I\u2019m ahead, then. Stress can ruin every day of your life.","4129":"So this is real? You\u2019ve really lost it. You\u2019re actually out of control.","4130":"Since the day I met you.","4131":"I thought this was some kind of ...","4132":"... trick.","4133":"Mr Holmes!","4134":"Thirty feet and closing: the most significant undetected serial killer in British criminal history.","4135":"What ... what plan?","4136":"Why not?","4137":"I don\u2019t do handshakes.  It\u2019ll have to be a hug.","4138":"Has it occurred to you \u2013 anywhere in your drug-addled brain \u2013 that you\u2019ve just been played?","4139":"For an ad campaign.","4140":"Brilliant?","4141":"Safest place to hide.","4142":"Culverton\u2019s doing a visit. The kids would love to meet you both. I think he sort of promised.","4143":"So ... what are we doing here? What\u2019s the point?","4144":"What do you think, Mr Holmes? \u2018Cereal\u2019 killer.","4145":"See you at the hospital.","4146":"Have what back?","4147":"Thanks for the hug.","4148":"It\u2019s password protected.","4149":"We\u2019re going to have endless fun, Mr Holmes, aren\u2019t we?","4150":"Need another hit, do you?","4151":"You mean my blog.","4152":"Oh, Mr Holmes. You feeling better?","4153":"I was just saying I love your blog.","4154":"It\u2019s my blog.","4155":"Oh, my God; I love your blog!","4156":"You all know Sherlock Holmes!","4157":"Mr Holmes. I was wondering \u2013 well ...  ... we all were, weren\u2019t we? \u2013 maybe you could tell us about some of your cases.","4158":"Yes.","4159":"Yes! Absolutely, yes.","4160":"I think you slightly gave away the ending.","4161":"One of them called Blessington.","4162":"Poison?","4163":"Okay.","4164":"Drearcliff House. Remember that one, John?","4165":"Ten, yeah.","4166":"Sherlock ...","4167":"Yeah, I called it Murder at the Zoo.","4168":"He should be wearing the hat. The kids\u2019d love the hat.","4169":"I don\u2019t think so.","4170":"Mr Holmes?","4171":"How do you catch a serial killer?","4172":"Serial killers choose their victims at random. Surely that must make it more difficult?","4173":"Do they really?","4174":"Serial killing is an expression of power, ego, a signature in human destruction.","4175":"Thank you so much for coming. Thank you.","4176":"I want to show you my favourite room.","4177":"No, let\u2019s go in here.","4178":"What\u2019s TD12?","4179":"Opt-in ignorance. Makes the world go round.","4180":"Some people take the drip out, yeah. Some people have the same ... urges. Huh ...  ... come on. Wasting time.","4181":"Sorry?","4182":"I sent a text from your phone, remember? It was read almost immediately. Factoring in a degree of shock, an emotional decision and a journey time based on the associated address, I\u2019d say that your life as you know it has twenty minutes left to run.","4183":"Speaking of serial killers, you know who\u2019s my favourite?","4184":"Relative of yours?","4185":"Home Secretary was there.","4186":"What d\u2019you think?","4187":"H. H. Holmes loved the dead. He mass-produced \u2019em.","4188":"I think you need to, er, tell your faithful little friend how you\u2019re wasting his time because you\u2019re too high to know what\u2019s real any more.","4189":"I apologise.","4190":"I-I-I\u2019ve miscalculated.","4191":"I forgot to factor in the traffic!","4192":"Nineteen and a half minutes.","4193":"Ah, the footsteps you\u2019re about to hear will be very familiar to you, not least because there\u2019ll be three impacts rather than two. The third, of course, will be the end of a walking cane.","4194":"And why would she be here?","4195":"You invited her.  You sent her a text \u2013 or-or-or technically I sent her a text but she\u2019s not to know.","4196":"Ah, let\u2019s see if I can recall.","4197":"Why would that have any effect?  You don\u2019t know her.","4198":"Oh, but I do.  I spent a whole evening with her.  We had chips.","4199":"You don\u2019t know Faith. You simply do not. .","4200":"I know you care about her deeply. I know you invited her to one of your special board meetings.  You care what she thinks.","4201":"You maintain an impressive fa\u00e7ade.","4202":"Did you know?","4203":"Of course I didn\u2019t.","4204":"Of course I didn\u2019t know.","4205":"Well, let\u2019s see, shall we?","4206":"Faith, stop loitering at the door and come in! This is your father\u2019s favourite room.","4207":"Favours Right.","4208":"Sherlock Holmes!  I love your blog.","4209":"Look, I didn\u2019t know he had the bloody scalpel.","4210":"Sherlock?","4211":"Oh, no!","4212":"I wasn\u2019t there.","4213":"Oh no!","4214":"Faith?","4215":"Sherlock? Are you all right? Sherlock, are you okay?","4216":"I\u2019ve got a what?!","4217":"You\u2019ve got a scalpel! You picked it up from that table.","4218":"I certainly did not!","4219":"What? .","4220":"Oh my God.","4221":"He\u2019s not laughing, Sherlock.","4222":"I don\u2019t really know what happened today. To be honest, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be standing here now if it wasn\u2019t for Doctor Watson.","4223":"Leave him be.","4224":"Don\u2019t think anyone else is going to save him, because there isn\u2019t anyone. It\u2019s up to you. Save him. But I do think you\u2019re gonna need a little bit of help with that, because you\u2019re not exactly good with people, so here\u2019s a few things you need to know about the man we both love \u2013 and more importantly what you\u2019re going to need to do to save him.","4225":"Policeman outside, you mean? Come on. Can\u2019t you guess?","4226":"I built this whole wing. Kept firing the architect and builders so no-one knew quite h-how it all fitted together. I can slip in and out anywhere I like, you know ... when I get the urge.","4227":"Why?","4228":"I\u2019d like to hear you say it.  Say it for me, please.","4229":"My car.","4230":"If you increase the dosage four or five times ...","4231":"Then I restore the settings. Everyone assumes it was a fault, or you just gave up the ghost. .","4232":"Before we start ...  ... tell me how you feel.","4233":"Be more specific.  You only get to do this the once.","4234":"You wanted this, though. .","4235":"But you don\u2019t actually want to die.","4236":"Good.  Say that for me. Say it.","4237":"And again.","4238":"Once more for luck.","4239":"I don\u2019t want to die. I don\u2019t ...","4240":"So tell me: why are we doing this? To what do I owe the pleasure?","4241":"But why do you need to die?","4242":"The mortuary; your favourite room.","4243":"You can\u2019t save John because he won\u2019t let you. He won\u2019t allow himself to be saved. The only way to save John ... is to make him save you.","4244":"Sherlock, what was he doing to you?","4245":"On what?","4246":"Saline?","4247":"What d\u2019you mean, saline?","4248":"You\u2019re okay?","4249":"No-no, of course I\u2019m not okay. Malnourished, double kidney failure, and frankly I\u2019ve been off my tits for weeks.  What kind of a doctor are you?","4250":"What would I be confessing to?","4251":"Um, all your possessions were searched.  Sorry.","4252":"You cock.","4253":"Utter, utter cock.","4254":"So how-how does it open?","4255":"Two weeks ago?","4256":"I\u2019m that predictable?","4257":"No.","4258":"... I can break America.","4259":"I had, of course, several other backup plans. Trouble is, I couldn\u2019t remember what they were.","4260":"... so that you\u2019d have something to do, something doctory. You get that now, though?","4261":"But she wasn\u2019t ever here?","4262":"Well, it sounds about right to me.  Possibly I\u2019m biased. .","4263":"... which is why we\u2019re all taking it in turns to keep you off the sweeties.","4264":"Molly\u2019ll be here in twenty minutes.","4265":"Uh, sorry, it\u2019s just, um, you know, Rosie.","4266":"You\u2019ll be okay for twenty minutes?","4267":"No problem.","4268":"Actually, he should wear the hat as a special tribute to me. I\u2019m dead. I would really appreciate it.","4269":"Sorry, what?","4270":"That\u2019s good.","4271":"Yeah.","4272":"... but the point is: you did not kill her.","4273":"Uh, I\u2019m tomorrow, six \u2019til ten. I\u2019ll see you then.","4274":"What was that?","4275":"That noise.","4276":"Oh, the posh boy loves the dominatrix!  He\u2019s never knowingly under-clich\u00e9d, is he?","4277":"I\u2019m gonna make a deduction.","4278":"And if my deduction is right, you\u2019re gonna be honest and tell me, okay?","4279":"Happy birthday.","4280":"Never knew when your birthday was.","4281":"Seriously, we\u2019re not gonna talk about this?","4282":"I mean, how does it work?","4283":"Harvester is a restaurant chain in the UK.  High Wycombe is a town in Buckinghamshire.","4284":"... but she\u2019s ... you know ... .","4285":"Just text her back.","4286":"Because High Wycombe is better than you are currently equipped to understand.","4287":"That\u2019s only the beginning, mate.","4288":"... would complete you as a human being.","4289":"She was wrong about me.","4290":"She thought that if you put yourself in harm\u2019s way I\u2019d ... I\u2019d rescue you or something. But I didn\u2019t \u2013 not \u2019til she told me to.  And that\u2019s how this works. That\u2019s what you\u2019re missing.  She taught me to be the man she already thought I was. Get yourself a piece of that.","4291":"Get the hell on with it.","4292":"It\u2019s not okay.","4293":"No.","4294":"But it is what it is.","4295":"Well, it\u2019s your birthday. Cake is obligatory.","4296":"Behave.","4297":"Right then. You know ...","4298":"... it\u2019s not my place to say but ... it was just texting.","4299":"People text.","4300":"Even I text. Her, I mean. Woman. Bad idea; try not to, but, you know, sometimes.","4301":"Even you?","4302":"No.","4303":"Cake?","4304":"Cake.","4305":"Seriously?!","4306":"I\u2019m Sherlock Holmes. I wear the damn hat.","4307":"Back to normal.","4308":"I swear my wife is channeling Satan!","4309":"I\u2019m not channelling Satan!","4310":"Obviously.","4311":"Sherlock? Help me!","4312":"This was you? All of this was you?","4313":"Conclusion two: my sister \u2013 Eurus, apparently \u2013 has been incarcerated from an early age in a secure institution controlled by my brother.","4314":"Why would you do this ...  ... this pantomime? Why?","4315":"That\u2019s not possible.","4316":"Shot me during a session.","4317":"Mm. We still had ten minutes to go.","4318":"Well, we\u2019ll see about a refund.","4319":"Right, you two. Wiggins has got your money by the gate.","4320":"Don\u2019t spend it all in one crack den.","4321":"You\u2019re just leaving?","4322":"Well, we\u2019re not staying here. Eurus is coming and, uh, someone\u2019s disabled all your security.","4323":"I\u2019m not a client.","4324":"So what happens now? Are you going to make deductions?","4325":"Who was it said, \u201cTruth is rarely pure, and never simple\u201d?","4326":"I don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t care. So there were three of us. I know that now. You, me, and ... Eurus.","4327":"Yes.","4328":"No.","4329":"Memories can resurface; wounds can re-open. The roads we walk have demons beneath ...  ... and yours have been waiting for a very long time. I never bullied you. I used \u2013 at discrete intervals \u2013 potential trigger words to update myself as to your mental condition. I was looking after you.","4330":"This is a private matter.","4331":"This is family.","4332":"You realise I\u2019m the smart one?","4333":"... but Eurus, she was incandescent even then. Our abilities were professionally assessed more than once. I was remarkable, but Eurus was described as an era-defining genius, beyond Newton.","4334":"The memories are disturbing.","4335":"Which one\u2019s pain?","4336":" ... who will find me \/ Deep down below the old beech tree? .","4337":"Help succour me now ...","4338":"... the East winds blow.","4339":"You\u2019re starting to remember.","4340":" ... brother, and under we go. .","4341":"After that, our sister had to be taken away.","4342":"She started another fire, one which she did not survive.","4343":"Yes. It is also a kindness. This is the story I told our parents to spare them further pain, and to account for the absence of an identifiable body.","4344":"Well, that too, of course. The depth of Eurus\u2019 psychosis and the extent of her abilities couldn\u2019t hope to be contained in any ordinary institution. Uncle Rudy took care of things.","4345":" My soul seeks \/ The shade of my willow\u2019s bloom ... .","4346":"What\u2019s it carrying?","4347":"The motion sensor has activated. If any of us move, the grenade will detonate.","4348":"It will certainly destroy this flat and kill anyone in it. Assuming walls of reasonable strength, your neighbours should be safe, but as it\u2019s landed on the floor, I am moved to wonder if the caf\u00e9 below is open.","4349":"What about Mrs Hudson?","4350":"Look, we have to move eventually. We should do it when she\u2019s safest.","4351":"When the vacuum stops, we give her eight seconds to get to the back of the flat. She\u2019s fast when she\u2019s cleaning. Then we move.","4352":"What\u2019s the trigger response time?","4353":"We have a maximum of three seconds to vacate the blast radius.","4354":"Me?","4355":"You\u2019re faster.","4356":"She\u2019s further away. She\u2019s moving to the back.","4357":"Phone call?","4358":"So did we. Now I recall. I was Lady Bracknell.","4359":"You really think so?","4360":"Well, that\u2019s good to know. I\u2019ve always wondered.","4361":"Good luck, boys.","4362":"Who the \u2019ell are you?","4363":"The detective!","4364":"Are you in?","4365":"A prison within a prison. Eurus must be allowed the strict minimum of human interaction.","4366":"Since you\u2019re determined to meet her, you\u2019re about to find out.","4367":"You \u2019aven\u2019t been down \u2019ere before, \u2019ave you? \u201cSilence of the Lambs,\u201d basically.","4368":"Keep your distance; stay at least three feet away from the glass an\u2019 all that.","4369":"She doesn\u2019t stop playin\u2019, sometimes for weeks.","4370":"Kills you in the end.","4371":"Did you bring it?","4372":"My hairband. Did you bring it like I asked?","4373":"My special hairband.","4374":"It was the last thing I said to you, remember, the day they took me away.","4375":"No?","4376":"Does this mean you didn\u2019t bring my hairband?","4377":"Easy. Look at me.","4378":"You can\u2019t see it, can you? You try and try but you just can\u2019t see; you can\u2019t look.","4379":"What do you think?","4380":"You\u2019re not looking at it.","4381":"Oh, the music.  I never know if it\u2019s beautiful or not; only if it\u2019s right.","4382":"Look at the violin.","4383":"Look at the violin.","4384":"It\u2019s a gift.","4385":"Me.","4386":"You play, don\u2019t you?","4387":"How did I know? I taught you, don\u2019t you remember? How can you not remember that?","4388":"Interesting. Mycroft told me you\u2019d rewritten your memories; he didn\u2019t tell me you\u2019d written me out completely.","4389":"Play for me.","4390":"No, not Bach; you clearly don\u2019t understand it. Play you.","4391":"Oh! Have you had sex?","4392":"The music. I\u2019ve had sex.","4393":"One of the nurses got careless. I liked it. Messy, though. People are so breakable.","4394":"He?","4395":"I don\u2019t trust you.","4396":"Sherlock.","4397":"Vatican Cameos.","4398":"Did they tell you to keep three feet from the glass?","4399":"Be naughty. Step closer.","4400":"Do it. Step closer.","4401":"You, me, and Mycroft.  Mycroft was quite clever. He could understand things if you went a bit slow but you ... you were my favourite.","4402":"Then Mummy and Daddy had to stop me, of course.","4403":"Well, turns out I got it wrong. Apparently, you were screaming.","4404":"Why was I screaming?","4405":"Redbeard.","4406":"Do you, now?","4407":"I don\u2019t need your help.","4408":"You think it\u2019s a trick. You look so ... unsure. You\u2019re not used to being unsure, are you?","4409":"Do you see how it was done? I know you like explanations.","4410":"Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s clever? Simple but clever?","4411":"Redbeard.","4412":"Bit of a lump.","4413":"Did you see your sister?","4414":"How was that?","4415":"Is this an occasion for banter?","4416":"Are we phoning someone?","4417":"What\u2019s he doing here?","4418":"Welcome ... to the final problem.","4419":"What is this? We can\u2019t do this!","4420":"Is this supposed to be a game?","4421":"Please help me!","4422":"I\u2019m not supposed to tell my name to strangers.","4423":"Of course not. Very good. But, um, I\u2019ll tell you mine. My name is ...","4424":"Loved it. Did you know his brother was a station master? I think he was always jealous.","4425":"... in about a minute.  Bang. Dead!","4426":"Well, you can stop me.","4427":"Eurus will kill her.","4428":"No.","4429":"Okay, fine.","4430":"I can\u2019t.  I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t do it.","4431":"I\u2019m sorry.","4432":"Remember me.","4433":"No!","4434":"Interesting.","4435":"When I tell you to use it \u2013 and I will \u2013 remember what happened this time.","4436":"Oh, the gun is intended as a mercy.","4437":"You.","4438":"Probably just take it.","4439":"Please, go through. There\u2019s a few tasks for you, and a girl on a plane is getting very, very scared.","4440":"Yes. You know, a violin.","4441":"She\u2019s very clever.","4442":"Come on now! Aaaaaall aboard!  Choo-choo! Choo-choo!","4443":"Is that allowed?","4444":"Barely dry. Recent.","4445":"Are-are you still there?","4446":"Yes, hello?","4447":"Yes.","4448":"That certainly narrows it down to half the planet.","4449":"Lots and lots, but they\u2019re all asleep. I can\u2019t wake them up.","4450":"Even the driver\u2019s asleep.","4451":"My nan\u2019s.","4452":"Home.","4453":"What\u2019s this? W-we\u2019re supposed to solve this based on what?","4454":"Please, make use of your friends, Sherlock. I want to see you interact with people that you\u2019re close to. Also, you may have to choose which one to keep.","4455":"Am I being asked to prove my usefulness?","4456":"I will not be manipulated like this.","4457":"Fine. John?","4458":"Yeah, I think I\u2019ve seen one of these. It\u2019s a buffalo gun.  I\u2019d say nineteen forties, old-fashioned sight, no crosshairs.","4459":"Glasses, glasses.  Nathan wears glasses. Evans was shot from three hundred metres.","4460":"Kickback from a gun with this calibre ...","4461":"... would be massive.","4462":"Once you bring in your verdict, let me know and justice will be done.","4463":"Early release.","4464":"We\u2019re going through the clouds, like cotton wool.","4465":"Why won\u2019t my mummy wake up?","4466":"So it\u2019s got to be one of the other two.","4467":"Now, Howard.","4468":"Howard\u2019s a lifelong drunk. Pallor of his skin, terminal gin blossoms on his red nose ...  ... and \u2013 terror notwithstanding \u2013 a bad case of the DTs.","4469":"There\u2019s no way he could have taken that shot from three hundred metres away.","4470":"So that leaves us with Alex.","4471":"He\u2019s shortsighted, or he was. His recent laser surgery has done the trick.","4472":"That\u2019s very good.","4473":"Excellent. Suddenly he sees himself in quite a different light now that he\u2019s dumped the specs. Even has a spray tan. But he\u2019s clearly not used to his new personal grooming ritual.","4474":"That can be told by the state of his fingernails and the fact that there\u2019s hair growing in his ears.  So it\u2019s a superficial job, then.","4475":"But he got his eyes fixed. His hands were steady. He pulled the trigger.","4476":"Sherlock, we can\u2019t do this.","4477":"Sherlock? Are you ready?","4478":"Condemn him in the knowledge of what will happen to the man you name.","4479":"No. That felt pretty much the same.","4480":"John.","4481":"Distract me?","4482":"Frightened. I\u2019m really frightened.","4483":"It\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry.","4484":"Just the sea. I can see the sea.","4485":"No ships. I can see lights in the distance.","4486":"Hello? Are you still there?","4487":"I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re going to have to give her hope.","4488":"Everyone\u2019s asleep. Will you help me?","4489":"I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m really scared.","4490":"Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.","4491":"Whose coffin, Sherlock? Please, start your deductions. I will apply some context in a moment.","4492":"Not a child?","4493":"A lonely night on Google.","4494":"This is a practical and informed choice. Balance of probability suggests that this is for an unmarried woman distant from her close relatives. That much is suggested by the economy of choice.","4495":"Irene Adler.","4496":"Molly.","4497":"No.","4498":"Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tick.","4499":"9.).","4500":"You never answer your phone.","4501":"Hello, Sherlock. Is this urgent, \u2019cause I\u2019m not having a good day.","4502":"Oh, God. Is this one of your stupid games?","4503":"Look, I\u2019m not at the lab.","4504":"Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tick.","4505":"What words?","4506":"Leave me alone.","4507":"Why are you doing this to me? Why are you making fun of me?","4508":"Softer, Sherlock!","4509":"I\u2019m not an experiment, Sherlock.","4510":"Please don\u2019t do this. Just ... just ... don\u2019t do it.","4511":"I can\u2019t say that. I can\u2019t ... I can\u2019t say that to you.","4512":"You know why.","4513":"Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tick-tick-tick ...","4514":"I can\u2019t. Not to you.","4515":"It\u2019s always been true.","4516":"You bastard.","4517":"You say it. Go on. You say it first.","4518":"1 and continues downwards. Mycroft, his head raised again, opens his mouth but can\u2019t find the words. He shakes his head and half steps forward, breathing out loudly. Sherlock faces the screen, his eyes closed. He takes a breath, summoning the strength to say the words.).","4519":"I-I ...","4520":"I love you.","4521":"I love you.","4522":"Molly?","4523":"Sherlock, however hard that was ...","4524":"Eurus, I won. I won.","4525":"Come on, play fair. The girl on the plane: I need to talk to her.","4526":"Sherlock?","4527":"Look, I know this is difficult and I know you\u2019re being tortured, but you have got to keep it together.","4528":"This isn\u2019t torture; this is vivisection. We\u2019re experiencing science from the perspective of lab rats.","4529":"Tick-tock, tickets please!","4530":"Well?","4531":"Shoot him.","4532":"Nothing more than a distraction; a little scrap of ordinariness for you to impress, to dazzle with your cleverness. You\u2019ll find another.","4533":"Why?","4534":"Because, on balance, even your Lady Bracknell was more convincing.","4535":"Ignore everything he just said. He\u2019s being kind. He\u2019s trying to make it easy for me to kill him.","4536":"Not in the face, though, please. I\u2019ve promised my brain to the Royal Society.","4537":"Moriarty.","4538":"Her Christmas treat: five minutes\u2019 conversation with Jim Moriarty five years ago.","4539":"This is where I get off.","4540":"Five minutes. It took her just five minutes to do all of this to us.","4541":"What are you doing?","4542":"A moment ago, a brave man asked to be remembered.","4543":"I\u2019m remembering the governor.","4544":"No, no, Sherlock.","4545":"Nine ...","4546":"You can\u2019t!","4547":"You don\u2019t know about Redbeard yet.","4548":"Sherlock!","4549":"Sherlock, stop that at once!","4550":"Four ...","4551":"Three ...","4552":"Hello? Are you still there?","4553":"You went away. You said you\u2019d help me and you went away.","4554":"Yes, I know. Well, I\u2019m sorry about that. We-we-we must have got cut off. Um ...","4555":"Hours. Hours and hours. Why don\u2019t grown-ups tell the truth?","4556":"Where did you go?","4557":"I\u2019m not completely sure.","4558":"Um, now, I tell you what. You-you\u2019ve got to be really, really brave for me.","4559":"The front?","4560":"Yes.","4561":"You mean where the driver is?","4562":"Okay.  I\u2019m going.","4563":"Yeah, I\u2019m here.","4564":"Yeah.","4565":"I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve just woken up. Where are you?","4566":"What, she\u2019s still up there?","4567":"Yes.  The plane will keep flying until it runs out of fuel.","4568":"I have no idea. I can hardly see anything.  Mycroft? Mycroft?","4569":"Yeah.","4570":"The walls are ...  ... rough. They\u2019re rock, I guess.","4571":"There are bones in here.","4572":"Uh, I dunno. S-small.","4573":"Who\u2019s Redbeard?","4574":"Yeah. I still can\u2019t wake the driver up.","4575":"I can see a river.  And there\u2019s-there\u2019s-there\u2019s a big wheel.","4576":"We are?","4577":"Yeah, there\u2019s nothing to it. We just need to get in touch with some people on the ground.","4578":"No.","4579":"That\u2019s all right. Well, we ... keep looking. We\u2019ve got plenty of time.","4580":"The whole plane\u2019s shaking.","4581":"My ears hurt.","4582":"A-a little bit.","4583":"I\u2019m in a well. That\u2019s where I am; I\u2019m in the bottom of a well.","4584":"Why would there be a well in Sherrinford?","4585":"Why is there a draught?","4586":"Walls don\u2019t contract after you\u2019ve painted them.","4587":"Not real ones.","4588":"... which reminded me of home.","4589":"Sweet Jim. He was never very interested in being alive, especially if he could make more trouble being dead.","4590":"You knew he\u2019d take his revenge. His revenge apparently is me.","4591":" Help succour me now ...","4592":" The East winds blow ...","4593":" Be not afraid ...","4594":"Yeah, it\u2019s flooding. The well is flooding.","4595":"What?","4596":"It\u2019s leaning over, the whole plane!","4597":"Eurus, you said the answer\u2019s in the song ...","4598":"... but I went through the song line by line all those years ago ...","4599":"... and I found nothing. I couldn\u2019t find anything. And there-there was a beech tree in the grounds and I dug.","4600":"Sherlock?  The bones I found.","4601":"... but we never had a dog.","4602":"Now it\u2019s coming.","4603":"Victor Trevor.","4604":"We played pirates. I was Yellowbeard and he was ...","4605":"You were inseparable. But I wanted to play too.","4606":"Oh. Oh God.","4607":"Come on, Redbeard!","4608":"Deep waters.","4609":"You killed him.","4610":"No-one.","4611":"Hello? Are you there?","4612":"But what about the plane?","4613":"Well, the puzzle will save the plane.","4614":"Is this strictly relevant?","4615":"The lights are getting closer.","4616":"Hush, now. Working.","4617":"Let\u2019s number the words of the song.","4618":"for this to work, we have to assume that the second large verse is actually the fourth verse of the song.).","4619":"I ... am ... lost ... Help ... me ... brother ... Save ... My ... Life ... Before ... my ... Doom.","4620":"I ... am ... Lost ... Without ... your ... love ... Save ... My ... soul ... seek ... my ... room.","4621":"We\u2019re going to crash! I\u2019m going to die!","4622":"I\u2019m not allowed to tell my name to strangers.","4623":"But I\u2019m not a stranger, am I?","4624":"I\u2019m your brother.","4625":"You\u2019re playing with me, Sherlock. We\u2019re playing the game.","4626":"And you\u2019re going to save me.","4627":"No, no.  It\u2019s too late now.","4628":"Every time I close my eyes, I\u2019m on the plane. I\u2019m lost, lost in the sky and ... no-one can hear me.","4629":"Open your eyes. I\u2019m here.","4630":"You\u2019re not lost any more.","4631":"Now, you ... you just ... you just went the wrong way last time, that\u2019s all.  This time, get it right.  Tell me how to save my friend.","4632":"Eurus ...","4633":"I just spoke to your brother.","4634":"Yeah. Give me a moment, boys.","4635":"Yeah, I\u2019ll take care of it.","4636":"You okay?","4637":"Well, you gave her what she was looking for: context.","4638":"Then you should have done better.","4639":"... there are two men sitting arguing in a scruffy flat ..."},"answer":{"0":"How fresh?","1":"Fine. We\u2019ll start with the riding crop.","2":"I need to know what bruises form in the next twenty minutes. A man\u2019s alibi depends on it. Text me.","3":"Are you wearing lipstick? You weren\u2019t wearing lipstick before.","4":"Sorry, you were saying?","5":"Black, two sugars, please. I\u2019ll be upstairs.","6":"Mike, can I borrow your phone? There\u2019s no signal on mine.","7":"I prefer to text.","8":"Oh. Thank you.","9":"Afghanistan or Iraq?","10":"Which was it \u2013 Afghanistan or Iraq?","11":"Ah, Molly, coffee. Thank you.","12":"What happened to the lipstick?","13":"Really? I thought it was a big improvement. Your mouth\u2019s too small now.","14":"How do you feel about the violin?","15":"I play the violin when I\u2019m thinking. Sometimes I don\u2019t talk for days on end.  Would that bother you? Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other.","16":"I did. Told Mike this morning that I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for. Now here he is just after lunch with an old friend, clearly just home from military service in Afghanistan. Wasn\u2019t that difficult a leap.","17":"Got my eye on a nice little place in central London. Together we ought to be able to afford it.","18":"We\u2019ll meet there tomorrow evening; seven o\u2019clock. Sorry \u2013 gotta dash. I think I left my riding crop in the mortuary.","19":"Is that what?","20":"Problem?","21":"I know you\u2019re an Army doctor and you\u2019ve been invalided home from Afghanistan. I know you\u2019ve got a brother who\u2019s worried about you but you won\u2019t go to him for help because you don\u2019t approve of him \u2013 possibly because he\u2019s an alcoholic; more likely because he recently walked out on his wife. And I know that your therapist thinks your limp\u2019s psychosomatic \u2013 quite correctly, I\u2019m afraid.","22":"That\u2019s enough to be going on with, don\u2019t you think?","23":"The name\u2019s Sherlock Holmes and the address is two two one B Baker Street.","24":"Afternoon.","25":"Hello.","26":"Thank you.","27":"Sherlock, please.","28":"Oh, Mrs Hudson, the landlady, she\u2019s giving me a special deal. Owes me a favour. A few years back, her husband got himself sentenced to death in Florida. I was able to help out.","29":"Oh no. I ensured it.","30":"Mrs Hudson, Doctor John Watson.","31":"Shall we?","32":"Yes. Yes, I think so. My thoughts precisely.","33":"So I went straight ahead and moved in.","34":"Well, obviously I can, um, straighten things up a bit.","35":"Friend of mine. When I say \u2018friend\u2019 ...","36":"Anything interesting?","37":"What did you think?","38":"Yes; and I can read your military career in your face and your leg, and your brother\u2019s drinking habits in your mobile phone.","39":"Four.","40":"There\u2019s been a fourth. And there\u2019s something different this time.","41":"Where?","42":"What\u2019s new about this one? You wouldn\u2019t have come to get me if there wasn\u2019t something different.","43":"Yeah.","44":"Who\u2019s on forensics?","45":"Anderson won\u2019t work with me.","46":"I need an assistant.","47":"Not in a police car. I\u2019ll be right behind.","48":"Brilliant! Yes! Ah, four serial suicides, and now a note! Oh, it\u2019s Christmas!","49":"Mrs Hudson, I\u2019ll be late. Might need some food.","50":"Something cold will do. John, have a cup of tea, make yourself at home. Don\u2019t wait up!","51":"You\u2019re a doctor. In fact you\u2019re an Army doctor.","52":"Any good?","53":"Seen a lot of injuries, then; violent deaths.","54":"Bit of trouble too, I bet.","55":"Wanna see some more?","56":"Impossible suicides? Four of them? There\u2019s no point sitting at home when there\u2019s finally something fun going on!","57":"Who cares about decent? The game, Mrs Hudson, is on!","58":"Taxi!","59":"Okay, you\u2019ve got questions.","60":"Crime scene. Next?","61":"What do you think?","62":"But?","63":"I\u2019m a consulting detective. Only one in the world. I invented the job.","64":"It means when the police are out of their depth, which is always, they consult me.","65":"When I met you for the first time yesterday, I said, \u201cAfghanistan or Iraq?\u201d You looked surprised.","66":"I didn\u2019t know, I saw. Your haircut, the way you hold yourself says military. But your conversation as you entered the room ...","67":"... said trained at Bart\u2019s, so Army doctor \u2013 obvious. Your face is tanned but no tan above the wrists. You\u2019ve been abroad, but not sunbathing. Your limp\u2019s really bad when you walk but you don\u2019t ask for a chair when you stand, like you\u2019ve forgotten about it, so it\u2019s at least partly psychosomatic. That says the original circumstances of the injury were traumatic. Wounded in action, then. Wounded in action, suntan \u2013 Afghanistan or Iraq.","68":"You\u2019ve got a psychosomatic limp \u2013 of course you\u2019ve got a therapist. Then there\u2019s your brother.","69":"Your phone. It\u2019s expensive, e-mail enabled, MP3 player, but you\u2019re looking for a flatshare \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t waste money on this. It\u2019s a gift, then.","70":"Scratches. Not one, many over time. It\u2019s been in the same pocket as keys and coins. The man sitting next to me wouldn\u2019t treat his one luxury item like this, so it\u2019s had a previous owner. Next bit\u2019s easy. You know it already.","71":"Harry Watson: clearly a family member who\u2019s given you his old phone. Not your father, this is a young man\u2019s gadget. Could be a cousin, but you\u2019re a war hero who can\u2019t find a place to live. Unlikely you\u2019ve got an extended family, certainly not one you\u2019re close to, so brother it is. Now, Clara. Who\u2019s Clara? Three kisses says it\u2019s a romantic attachment. The expense of the phone says wife, not girlfriend. She must have given it to him recently \u2013 this model\u2019s only six months old. Marriage in trouble then \u2013 six months on he\u2019s just given it away. If she\u2019d left him, he would have kept it. People do \u2013 sentiment. But no, he wanted rid of it. He left her. He gave the phone to you: that says he wants you to stay in touch. You\u2019re looking for cheap accommodation, but you\u2019re not going to your brother for help: that says you\u2019ve got problems with him. Maybe you liked his wife; maybe you don\u2019t like his drinking.","72":"Shot in the dark. Good one, though. Power connection: tiny little scuff marks around the edge of it. Every night he goes to plug it in to charge but his hands are shaking. You never see those marks on a sober man\u2019s phone; never see a drunk\u2019s without them.","73":"There you go, you see \u2013 you were right.","74":"The police don\u2019t consult amateurs.","75":"Do you think so?","76":"That\u2019s not what people normally say.","77":"\u2018Piss off\u2019!","78":"Did I get anything wrong?","79":"Spot on, then. I didn\u2019t expect to be right about everything.","80":"Harry\u2019s your sister.","81":"Sister!","82":"There\u2019s always something.","83":"I\u2019m here to see Detective Inspector Lestrade.","84":"I was invited.","85":"I think he wants me to take a look.","86":"Always, Sally.  I even know you didn\u2019t make it home last night.","87":"Colleague of mine, Doctor Watson.","88":"Doctor Watson, Sergeant Sally Donovan.  Old friend.","89":"No.","90":"Ah, Anderson. Here we are again.","91":"Quite clear. And is your wife away for long?","92":"Your deodorant told me that.","93":"It\u2019s for men.","94":"So\u2019s Sergeant Donovan.","95":"Ooh, and I think it just vaporised. May I go in?","96":"I\u2019m not implying anything.","97":"I\u2019m sure Sally came round for a nice little chat, and just happened to stay over.","98":"And I assume she scrubbed your floors, going by the state of her knees.","99":"You need to wear one of these.","100":"He\u2019s with me.","101":"I said he\u2019s with me.","102":"So where are we?","103":"May need longer.","104":"Shut up.","105":"You were thinking. It\u2019s annoying.","106":"Not much.","107":"Yes, thank you for your input.","108":"Of course she\u2019s not. She\u2019s from out of town, though. Intended to stay in London for one night ...  ... before returning home to Cardiff.","109":"So far, so obvious.","110":"Doctor Watson, what do you think?","111":"Of the body. You\u2019re a medical man.","112":"They won\u2019t work with me.","113":"Yes ... because you need me.","114":"Doctor Watson.","115":"Well?","116":"Helping me make a point.","117":"Yeah, well, this is more fun.","118":"Perfectly sound analysis, but I was hoping you\u2019d go deeper.","119":"You know what it was. You\u2019ve read the papers.","120":"Victim is in her late thirties. Professional person, going by her clothes; I\u2019m guessing something in the media, going by the frankly alarming shade of pink. Travelled from Cardiff today, intending to stay in London for one night. It\u2019s obvious from the size of her suitcase.","121":"Suitcase, yes. She\u2019s been married at least ten years, but not happily. She\u2019s had a string of lovers but none of them knew she was married.","122":"Her wedding ring. Ten years old at least. The rest of her jewellery has been regularly cleaned, but not her wedding ring. State of her marriage right there. The inside of the ring is shinier than the outside \u2013 that means it\u2019s regularly removed. The only polishing it gets is when she works it off her finger. It\u2019s not for work; look at her nails. She doesn\u2019t work with her hands, so what or rather who does she remove her rings for? Clearly not one lover; she\u2019d never sustain the fiction of being single over that amount of time, so more likely a string of them. Simple.","123":"It\u2019s obvious, isn\u2019t it?","124":"Dear God, what is it like in your funny little brains? It must be so boring.","125":"Her coat: it\u2019s slightly damp. She\u2019s been in heavy rain in the last few hours. No rain anywhere in London in that time. Under her coat collar is damp, too. She\u2019s turned it up against the wind. She\u2019s got an umbrella in her left-hand pocket but it\u2019s dry and unused: not just wind, strong wind \u2013 too strong to use her umbrella. We know from her suitcase that she was intending to stay overnight, so she must have come a decent distance but she can\u2019t have travelled more than two or three hours because her coat still hasn\u2019t dried. So, where has there been heavy rain and strong wind within the radius of that travel time?  Cardiff.","126":"D\u2019you know you do that out loud?","127":"No, it\u2019s ... fine.","128":"Yes, where is it? She must have had a phone or an organiser. Find out who Rachel is.","129":"No, she was leaving an angry note in German Of course she was writing Rachel; no other word it can be. Question is: why did she wait until she was dying to write it?","130":"Back of the right leg: tiny splash marks on the heel and calf, not present on the left. She was dragging a wheeled suitcase behind her with her right hand. Don\u2019t get that splash pattern any other way. Smallish case, going by the spread. Case that size, woman this clothes-conscious: could only be an overnight bag, so we know she was staying one night.","131":"Now, where is it? What have you done with it?","132":"Say that again.","133":"Suitcase! Did anyone find a suitcase? Was there a suitcase in this house?","134":"But they take the poison themselves; they chew, swallow the pills themselves. There are clear signs, even you lot couldn\u2019t miss them.","135":"It\u2019s murder, all of them. I don\u2019t know how, but they\u2019re not suicides, they\u2019re killings \u2013 serial killings.","136":"We\u2019ve got ourselves a serial killer. I love those. There\u2019s always something to look forward to.","137":"Her case! Come on, where is her case? Did she eat it? Someone else was here, and they took her case.  So the killer must have driven her here; forgot the case was in the car.","138":"No, she never got to the hotel. Look at her hair. She colour-coordinates her lipstick and her shoes. She\u2019d never have left any hotel with her hair still looking ...","139":"Oh.","140":"Oh!","141":"Serial killers are always hard. You have to wait for them to make a mistake.","142":"Oh, we\u2019re done waiting!","143":"Look at her, really look! Houston, we have a mistake. Get on to Cardiff: find out who Jennifer Wilson\u2019s family and friends were. Find Rachel!","144":"PINK!","145":"Nicotine patch. Helps me think.","146":"Impossible to sustain a smoking habit in London these days. Bad news for brain work.","147":"Oh, breathing. Breathing\u2019s boring.","148":"It\u2019s a three-patch problem.","149":"Oh, yeah, of course. Can I borrow your phone?","150":"Don\u2019t wanna use mine. Always a chance that the number will be recognised. It\u2019s on the website.","151":"Yeah, she\u2019s downstairs. I tried shouting but she didn\u2019t hear.","152":"There was no hurry.","153":"Her case.","154":"Her suitcase, yes, obviously. The murderer took her suitcase. First big mistake.","155":"It\u2019s no use, there\u2019s no other way. We\u2019ll have to risk it.","156":"On my desk there\u2019s a number. I want you to send a text.","157":"Text, yes. The number on my desk.","158":"What\u2019s wrong?","159":"A friend?","160":"Oh. Which one?","161":"Did he offer you money to spy on me?","162":"Did you take it?","163":"Pity. We could have split the fee. Think it through next time.","164":"The most dangerous man you\u2019ve ever met, and not my problem right now.  On my desk, the number.","165":"Yes. That\u2019s not important. Just enter the number.","166":"Are you doing it?","167":"Have you done it?","168":"These words exactly: \u201cWhat happened at Lauriston Gardens? I must have blacked out.\u201d","169":"\u201cTwenty-two Northumberland Street. Please come.\u201d","170":"What? No. No!","171":"Type and send it. Quickly.","172":"Have you sent it?","173":"Twenty-two Northumberland Street. Hurry up!","174":"Yes, obviously.","175":"Oh, perhaps I should mention: I didn\u2019t kill her.","176":"Why not? Given the text I just had you send and the fact I that have her case, it\u2019s a perfectly logical assumption.","177":"Now and then, yes.","178":"By looking.","179":"The killer must have driven her to Lauriston Gardens. He could only keep her case by accident if it was in the car. Nobody could be seen with this case without drawing attention \u2013 particularly a man, which is statistically more likely \u2013 so obviously he\u2019d feel compelled to get rid of it the moment he noticed he still had it. Wouldn\u2019t have taken him more than five minutes to realise his mistake. I checked every back street wide enough for a car five minutes from Lauriston Gardens ...","180":"... and anywhere you could dispose of a bulky object without being observed.","181":"Took me less than an hour to find the right skip.","182":"Well, it had to be pink, obviously.","183":"Because you\u2019re an idiot.","184":"No, no, no, don\u2019t look like that. Practically everyone is.","185":"Now, look. Do you see what\u2019s missing?","186":"Her phone. Where\u2019s her mobile phone? There was no phone on the body, there\u2019s no phone in the case. We know she had one \u2013 that\u2019s her number there; you just texted it.","187":"She has a string of lovers and she\u2019s careful about it. She never leaves her phone at home.","188":"Well, the question is: where is her phone now?","189":"Yes, or ...?","190":"Maybe she left it when she left her case. Maybe he took it from her for some reason. Either way, the balance of probability is the murderer has her phone.","191":"A few hours after his last victim, and now he receives a text that can only be from her. If somebody had just found that phone they\u2019d ignore a text like that, but the murderer ...","192":"... would panic.","193":"Four people are dead. There isn\u2019t time to talk to the police.","194":"Mrs Hudson took my skull.","195":"Relax, you\u2019re doing fine.","196":"Well?","197":"Well, you could just sit there and watch telly.","198":"I like company when I go out, and I think better when I talk aloud. The skull just attracts attention, so ...","199":"Problem?","200":"What about her?","201":"And I said \u201cdangerous\u201d, and here you are.","202":"Northumberland Street\u2019s a five-minute walk from here.","203":"No \u2013 I think he\u2019s brilliant enough. I love the brilliant ones. They\u2019re always so desperate to get caught.","204":"Appreciation! Applause! At long last the spotlight. That\u2019s the frailty of genius, John: it needs an audience.","205":"This is his hunting ground, right here in the heart of the city. Now that we know his victims were abducted, that changes everything. Because all of his victims disappeared from busy streets, crowded places, but nobody saw them go.","206":"Think! Who do we trust, even though we don\u2019t know them? Who passes unnoticed wherever they go? Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?","207":"Haven\u2019t the faintest. Hungry?","208":"Thank you, Billy.","209":"Twenty-two Northumberland Street. Keep your eyes on it.","210":"He has killed four people.","211":"Do you want to eat?","212":"This is Angelo.","213":"Three years ago I successfully proved to Lestrade at the time of a particularly vicious triple murder that Angelo was in a completely different part of town, house-breaking.","214":"I cleared it a bit. Anything happening opposite?","215":"You did go to prison.","216":"You may as well eat. We might have a long wait.","217":"I\u2019m sorry?","218":"Doesn\u2019t it? Sounds a bit dull.","219":"What do real people have, then, in their \u2018real lives\u2019?","220":"Yes, well, as I was saying \u2013 dull.","221":"Girlfriend? No, not really my area.","222":"I know it\u2019s fine.","223":"No.","224":"John, um ... I think you should know that I consider myself married to my work, and while I\u2019m flattered by your interest, I\u2019m really not looking for any ...","225":"Good. Thank you.","226":"Look across the street. Taxi.","227":"Stopped. Nobody getting in, and nobody getting out.","228":"Why a taxi? Oh, that\u2019s clever. Is it clever? Why is it clever?","229":"Don\u2019t stare.","230":"We can\u2019t both stare.","231":"Good for you.","232":"Right turn, one way, roadworks, traffic lights, bus lane, pedestrian crossing, left turn only, traffic lights.","233":"Come on, John.","234":"Come on, John. We\u2019re losing him!","235":"Ah, no!","236":"This way.","237":"No, this way!","238":"Police! Open her up!","239":"No.","240":"Teeth, tan: what \u2013 Californian?","241":"L.A., Santa Monica. Just arrived.","242":"The luggage.","243":"It\u2019s probably your first trip to London, right, going by your final destination and the route the cabbie was taking you?","244":"Yeah.  Everything all right?","245":"Welcome to London.","246":"Basically.","247":"Not the murderer, no.","248":"As they go.","249":"Yeah. I pickpocket him when he\u2019s annoying. You can keep that one, I\u2019ve got plenty at the flat.","250":"What?","251":"Got your breath back?","252":"And you invaded Afghanistan.","253":"Oh, they can keep an eye out. It was a long shot anyway.","254":"Oh, just passing the time.","255":"And proving a point.","256":"You.","257":"Mrs Hudson! Doctor Watson will take the room upstairs.","258":"Says the man at the door.","259":"Mrs Hudson?","260":"What are you doing?","261":"You can\u2019t just break into my flat.","262":"Well, what do you call this then?","263":"John ...","264":"John, you probably want to shut up now.","265":"What?","266":"Shut up!","267":"I\u2019m not your sniffer dog.","268":"What, An...","269":"Anderson, what are you doing here on a drugs bust?","270":"Put those back!","271":"It\u2019s an experiment.","272":"This is childish.","273":"Oh, what, so-so-so you set up a pretend drugs bust to bully me?","274":"I am clean!","275":"I don\u2019t even smoke.","276":"Who is she?","277":"Her daughter? Why would she write her daughter\u2019s name? Why?","278":"I\u2019m not a psychopath, Anderson. I\u2019m a high-functioning sociopath. Do your research.","279":"You need to bring Rachel in. You need to question her. I need to question her.","280":"Excellent!","281":"How, when and why? Is there a connection? There has to be.","282":"No, that\u2019s ... that\u2019s not right. How ... Why would she do that? Why?","283":"She didn\u2019t think about her daughter. She scratched her name on the floor with her fingernails. She was dying. It took effort. It would have hurt.","284":"Yeah, but that was ages ago. Why would she still be upset?","285":"Not good?","286":"Yeah, but if you were dying ... if you\u2019d been murdered: in your very last few seconds what would you say?","287":"Oh, use your imagination!","288":"Yeah, but if you were clever, really clever ... Jennifer Wilson running all those lovers: she was clever.","289":"She\u2019s trying to tell us something.","290":"I didn\u2019t order a taxi. Go away.","291":"Shut up, everybody, shut up! Don\u2019t move, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t breathe. I\u2019m trying to think. Anderson, face the other way. You\u2019re putting me off.","292":"Come on, think. Quick!","293":"MRS HUDSON!","294":"Oh.","295":"Ah! She was clever, clever, yes!","296":"She\u2019s cleverer than you lot and she\u2019s dead. Do you see, do you get it? She didn\u2019t lose her phone, she never lost it. She planted it on him.","297":"When she got out of the car, she knew that she was going to her death. She left the phone in order to lead us to her killer.","298":"Wha...? What do you mean, how?","299":"Rachel!","300":"Don\u2019t you see? Rachel!","301":"Oh, look at you lot. You\u2019re all so vacant. Is it nice not being me? It must be so relaxing.  Rachel is not a name.","302":"John, on the luggage, there\u2019s a label. E-mail address.","303":"Oh, I\u2019ve been too slow. She didn\u2019t have a laptop, which means she did her business on her phone, so it\u2019s a smartphone, it\u2019s e-mail enabled.","304":"So there was a website for her account. The username is her e-mail address ...","305":"... and all together now, the password is?","306":"Anderson, don\u2019t talk out loud. You lower the I.Q. of the whole street. We can do much more than just read her e-mails. It\u2019s a smartphone, it\u2019s got GPS, which means if you lose it you can locate it online. She\u2019s leading us directly to the man who killed her.","307":"Come on, come on. Quickly!","308":"Mrs Hudson, isn\u2019t it time for your evening soother?","309":"We need to get vehicles, get a helicopter.","310":"We\u2019re gonna have to move fast. This phone battery won\u2019t last for ever.","311":"It\u2019s a start!","312":"It narrows it down from just anyone in London. It\u2019s the first proper lead that we\u2019ve had.","313":"What is it? Quickly, where?","314":"How can it be here? How?","315":"What, and I didn\u2019t notice it? Me? I didn\u2019t notice?","316":"\u2018Who do we trust, even if we don\u2019t know them?\u2019","317":"\u2018Who passes unnoticed wherever they go?\u2019","318":"\u2018Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?\u2019","319":"What? Yeah, yeah, I-I\u2019m fine.","320":"Dunno.","321":"Good idea.","322":"Fresh air. Just popping outside for a moment. Won\u2019t be long.","323":"I\u2019m fine.","324":"I didn\u2019t order a taxi.","325":"You\u2019re the cabbie. The one who stopped outside Northumberland Street.","326":"It was you, not your passenger.","327":"Is this a confession?","328":"Why?","329":"Am I not?","330":"No-one else will die, though, and I believe they call that a result.","331":"If I wanted to understand, what would I do?","332":"So you can kill me too?","333":"How did you find me?","334":"Who warned you about me?","335":"Who?","336":"Who would notice me?","337":"I\u2019m really not.","338":"Tell me more.","339":"Where are we?","340":"Roland-Kerr Further Education College. Why here?","341":"And you just walk your victims in? How?","342":"Oh, dull.","343":"You can\u2019t make people take their own lives at gunpoint.","344":"No, I\u2019m not.","345":"Bit risky, wasn\u2019t it? Took me away under the eye of about half a dozen policemen. They\u2019re not that stupid. And Mrs Hudson will remember you.","346":"Love what?","347":"My fan?","348":"Oh, I see. So you\u2019re a proper genius too.","349":"Okay, two bottles. Explain.","350":"Both bottles are of course identical.","351":"And you know which is which.","352":"But I don\u2019t.","353":"Why should I? I\u2019ve got nothing to go on. What\u2019s in it for me?","354":"This is what you did to the rest of them: you gave them a choice.","355":"It\u2019s not a game. It\u2019s chance.","356":"Play what? It\u2019s a fifty-fifty chance.","357":"Still just chance.","358":"Luck.","359":"Either way, you\u2019re wasted as a cabbie.","360":"So, you risked your life four times just to kill strangers. Why?","361":"Oh, I am playing. This is my turn. There\u2019s shaving foam behind your left ear. Nobody\u2019s pointed it out to you.","362":"Traces of where it\u2019s happened before, so obviously you live on your own; there\u2019s no-one to tell you.","363":"But there\u2019s a photograph of children. The children\u2019s mother has been cut out of the picture. If she\u2019d died, she\u2019d still be there.","364":"The photograph\u2019s old but the frame\u2019s new. You think of your children but you don\u2019t get to see them.","365":"Estranged father. She took the kids, but you still love them and it still hurts.","366":"Ah, but there\u2019s more.","367":"Your clothes: recently laundered but everything you\u2019re wearing\u2019s at least ... three years old? Keeping up appearances but not planning ahead. And here you are on a kamikaze murder spree. What\u2019s that about?","368":"Ahh. Three years ago \u2013 is that when they told you?","369":"That you\u2019re a dead man walking.","370":"You don\u2019t have long, though. Am I right?","371":"And because you\u2019re dying, you\u2019ve just murdered four people.","372":"No. No, there\u2019s something else. You didn\u2019t just kill four people because you\u2019re bitter. Bitterness is a paralytic. Love is a much more vicious motivator. Somehow this is about your children.","373":"But how?","374":"Or serial killing.","375":"Surprise me.","376":"You have a what?","377":"Who\u2019d sponsor a serial killer?","378":"What d\u2019you mean, more than a man? An organisation? What?","379":"What if I don\u2019t choose either? I could just walk out of here.","380":"I\u2019ll have the gun, please.","381":"Definitely. The gun.","382":"The gun.","383":"I know a real gun when I see one.","384":"Clearly. Well, this has been very interesting. I look forward to the court case.","385":"Of course. Child\u2019s play.","386":"Was I right?","387":"I was, wasn\u2019t I? Did I get it right?","388":"Okay, tell me this: your sponsor. Who was it? The one who told you about me \u2013 my \u2018fan\u2019. I want a name.","389":"You\u2019re dying, but there\u2019s still time to hurt you. Give me a name.","390":"A name.","391":"Now.","392":"The NAME!","393":"Why have I got this blanket? They keep putting this blanket on me.","394":"I\u2019m not in shock.","395":"So, the shooter. No sign?","396":"Oh, I wouldn\u2019t say that.","397":"The bullet they just dug out of the wall\u2019s from a hand gun. Kill shot over that distance from that kind of a weapon \u2013 that\u2019s a crack shot you\u2019re looking for, but not just a marksman; a fighter. His hands couldn\u2019t have shaken at all, so clearly he\u2019s acclimatised to violence. He didn\u2019t fire until I was in immediate danger, though, so strong moral principle. You\u2019re looking for a man probably with a history of military service ...","398":"... and nerves of steel ...","399":"Actually, do you know what? Ignore me.","400":"Ignore all of that. It\u2019s just the, er, the shock talking.","401":"I just need to talk about the-the rent.","402":"Oh, what now? I\u2019m in shock! Look, I\u2019ve got a blanket!","403":"And I just caught you a serial killer ... more or less.","404":"Good shot.","405":"Well, you\u2019d know.","406":"Need to get the powder burns out of your fingers. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d serve time for this, but let\u2019s avoid the court case.","407":"Are you all right?","408":"Well, you have just killed a man.","409":"No. No, he wasn\u2019t really, was he?","410":"That\u2019s true. He was a bad cabbie. Should have seen the route he took us to get here!","411":"You\u2019re the one who shot him. Don\u2019t blame me.","412":"Sorry.","413":"Course I wasn\u2019t. Biding my time. Knew you\u2019d turn up.","414":"Why would I do that?","415":"Dinner?","416":"End of Baker Street, there\u2019s a good Chinese stays open \u2019til two. You can always tell a good Chinese by examining the bottom third of the door handle.","417":"I know exactly who that is.","418":"What are you doing here?","419":"Yes, I\u2019ve been hearing about your \u2018concern\u2019.","420":"Oddly enough, no!","421":"I upset her? Me?","422":"It wasn\u2019t me that upset her, Mycroft.","423":"Mother \u2013 our mother. This is my brother, Mycroft.","424":"Putting on weight again?","425":"Of course he\u2019s my brother.","426":"Not what?","427":"Close enough.","428":"He is the British government, when he\u2019s not too busy being the British Secret Service or the CIA on a freelance basis.","429":"Good evening, Mycroft. Try not to start a war before I get home. You know what it does for the traffic.","430":"Mmm! I can always predict the fortune cookies.","431":"Almost can. You did get shot, though.","432":"In Afghanistan. There was an actual wound.","433":"Shoulder! I thought so.","434":"The left one.","435":"I never guess.","436":"Moriarty.","437":"I\u2019ve absolutely no idea.","438":"Look!","439":"You took your time.","440":"What? Why not?","441":"You ... you had a row with a machine?","442":"Take my card.","443":"Not interested.","444":"I sent them a message.","445":"Of course.","446":"Mine was in the bedroom.","447":"In a manner of speaking. Took me less than a minute to guess yours.  Not exactly Fort Knox.","448":"Oh, dull.","449":"I need to go to the bank.","450":"Sherlock Holmes.","451":"Sebastian.","452":"This is my friend, John Watson.","453":"So, you\u2019re doing well. You\u2019ve been abroad a lot.","454":"Flying all the way round the world twice in a month?","455":"It\u2019s not a trick.","456":"I simply observed.","457":"No, I ...","458":"I was just chatting with your secretary outside. She told me.","459":"How many ways into that office?","460":"That door didn\u2019t open last night.","461":"I don\u2019t need an incentive, Sebastian.","462":"Did you see his watch?","463":"The time was right but the date was wrong. Said two days ago. Crossed the dateline twice but he didn\u2019t alter it.","464":"New Breitling.","465":"Only came out this February.","466":"Got everything I need to know already, thanks.","467":"That graffiti was a message for someone at the bank working on the trading floors. We find the intended recipient and ...","468":"Obvious.","469":"Pillars.","470":"Pillars and the screens. Very few places you can see that graffiti from. That narrows the field considerably. And of course the message was left at eleven thirty-four last night. That tells us a lot.","471":"Traders come to work at all hours. Some trade with Hong Kong in the middle of the night. That message was intended for someone who came in at midnight.","472":"Not many Van Coons in the phonebook.","473":"Taxi!","474":"Just moved in.","475":"The floor above. New label.","476":"No-one ever does that.","477":"Hi! Um, I live in the flat just below you. I-I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve met.","478":"Actually, I\u2019ve just locked my keys in my flat.","479":"Yeah. And can I use your balcony?","480":"We don\u2019t know that it was suicide.","481":"Been away three days, judging by the laundry.","482":"Look at the case. There was something tightly packed inside it.","483":"Problem?","484":"Those symbols at the bank \u2013 the graffiti. Why were they put there?","485":"Obviously.","486":"Why were they painted? If you want to communicate, why not use e-mail?","487":"Oh good. You follow.","488":"What kind of a message would everyone try to avoid?","489":"What about this morning \u2013 those letters you were looking at?","490":"Yes. He was being threatened.","491":"Ah, Sergeant. We haven\u2019t met.","492":"I\u2019ve phoned Lestrade. Is he on his way?","493":"Wrong. It\u2019s one possible explanation of some of the facts.","494":"You\u2019ve got a solution that you like, but you\u2019re choosing to ignore anything you see that doesn\u2019t comply with it.","495":"The wound was on the right side of his head.","496":"Van Coon was left-handed.","497":"Requires quite a bit of contortion.","498":"Oh, I\u2019m amazed you didn\u2019t notice. All you have to do is look around this flat.","499":"Coffee table on the left-hand side; coffee mug handle pointing to the left. Power sockets: habitually used the ones on the left ...","500":"Pen and paper on the left-hand side of the phone because he picked it up with his right and took down messages with his left. D\u2019you want me to go on?","501":"Oh, I might as well; I\u2019m almost at the bottom of the list.","502":"There\u2019s a knife on the breadboard with butter on the right side of the blade because he used it with his left.","503":"It\u2019s highly unlikely that a left-handed man would shoot himself in the right side of his head.","504":"Conclusion: someone broke in here and murdered him. Only explanation of all the facts.","505":"He was waiting for the killer. He\u2019d been threatened.","506":"He fired a shot when his attacker came in.","507":"Went through the open window.","508":"Wait until you get the ballistics report. The bullet in his brain wasn\u2019t fired from his gun. I guarantee it.","509":"Good! You\u2019re finally asking the right questions.","510":"It was a threat. That\u2019s what the graffiti meant.","511":"I don\u2019t think this can wait. Sorry, Sebastian. One of your traders \u2013 someone who worked in your office \u2013 was killed.","512":"Sorry to interfere with everyone\u2019s digestion. Still wanna make an appointment? Would, maybe, nine o\u2019clock at Scotland Yard suit?","513":"Well, they\u2019ve got it wrong, Sebastian. He was murdered.","514":"Seb.","515":"I said, \u201cCould you pass me a pen?\u201d","516":"\u2019Bout an hour ago.","517":"How was it?","518":"Who?","519":"\u201cShe\u201d?","520":"Here, have a look.","521":"Happened last night. Journalist shot dead in his flat; doors locked, windows bolted from the inside \u2013 exactly the same as Van Coon.","522":"He\u2019s killed another one.","523":"Brian Lukis, freelance journalist. Murdered in his flat ...","524":"... doors locked from the inside.","525":"Inspector, do you seriously believe that Eddie Van Coon was just another City suicide?","526":"You have seen the ballistics report, I suppose?","527":"And the shot that killed him: was it fired from his own gun?","528":"No. So this investigation might move a bit quicker if you were to take my word as gospel.","529":"I\u2019ve just handed you a murder enquiry.  Five minutes in his flat.","530":"Four floors up. That\u2019s why they think they\u2019re safe. Put a chain across the door and bolt it shut; think they\u2019re impregnable.","531":"They don\u2019t reckon for one second that there\u2019s another way in.","532":"You\u2019re dealing with a killer who can climb.","533":"He clings to the walls like an insect.","534":"That\u2019s how he got in.","535":"Climbed up the side of the walls, ran along the roof, dropped in through this skylight.","536":"He scaled six floors of a Docklands apartment building, jumped the balcony to kill Van Coon.","537":"And of course that\u2019s how he got into the bank. He ran along the window ledge and onto the terrace.","538":"We have to find out what connects these two men.","539":"Date stamped on the book is the same day that he died.","540":"So, the killer goes to the bank, leaves a threatening cipher for Van Coon; Van Coon panics, returns to his apartment, locks himself in.","541":"Hours later, he dies.","542":"Late that night, he dies too.","543":"Only the cipher can tell us.","544":"The world\u2019s run on codes and ciphers, John. From the million-pound security system at the bank, to the PIN machine you took exception to, cryptography inhabits our every waking moment.","545":"... but it\u2019s all computer-generated: electronic codes, electronic ciphering methods. This is different. It\u2019s an ancient device. Modern code-breaking methods won\u2019t unravel it.","546":"I need to ask some advice.","547":"You heard me perfectly. I\u2019m not saying it again.","548":"On painting, yes. I need to talk to an expert.","549":"Interesting.","550":"Know the author?","551":"What about the symbols: d\u2019you recognise them?","552":"Two men have been murdered, Raz. Deciphering this is the key to finding out who killed them.","553":"Are you gonna help us or not?","554":"Somebody must know something about it.","555":"You\u2019ve been a while.","556":"What?","557":"Good. Fine.","558":"This symbol: I still can\u2019t place it.","559":"No, I need you to go to the police station ...","560":"... ask about the journalist.","561":"His personal effects will have been impounded. Get hold of his diary, or something that will tell us his movements.","562":"Gonna go and see Van Coon\u2019s P.A. If we retrace their steps, somewhere they\u2019ll coincide.","563":"Can you print me up a copy?","564":"What about the day he died? Can you tell me where he was?","565":"What kind of a boss was he, Amanda? Appreciative?","566":"Like that hand cream. He bought that for you, didn\u2019t he?","567":"Look at this one. Got a taxi from home on the day he died. Eighteen pounds fifty.","568":"Not rush hour; check the time. Mid-morning. Eighteen would get him as far as ...","569":"Underground. Printed at one in Piccadilly.","570":"Because he was delivering something heavy. Didn\u2019t want to lug a package up the escalator.","571":"To somewhere near Piccadilly Station. Dropped the package, delivered it and then ...","572":"... stopped on his way. He got peckish.","573":"So you bought your lunch from here en route to the station, but where were you headed from? Where did the taxi drop you ...?","574":"Eddie Van Coon brought a package here the day he died \u2013 whatever was hidden inside that case. I\u2019ve managed to piece together a picture using scraps of information ...","575":"\u2026 credit card bills, receipts. He flew back from China, then he came here.","576":"Somewhere in this street; somewhere near. I don\u2019t know where, but ...","577":"How can you tell?","578":"Oh.","579":"Yes, I see it.","580":"It\u2019s an ancient number system! Hangzhou.","581":"These days, only street traders use it. Those were numbers written on the wall at the bank and at the library.","582":"Numbers written in an ancient Chinese dialect.","583":"And the blindfold \u2013 the horizontal line? That was a number as well.","584":"The Chinese number one, John.","585":"It\u2019s not what they saw; it\u2019s what they both brought back in those suitcases.","586":"Think about what Sebastian told us; about Van Coon \u2013 about how he stayed afloat in the market.","587":"... made it back in a week.","588":"That\u2019s how he made such easy money.","589":"A guy like him \u2013 it would have been perfect.","590":"Business man ...","591":"... making frequent trips to Asia. And Lukis was the same ...","592":"... a journalist writing about China.","593":"Both of them smuggled stuff out, and the Lucky Cat was their drop-off.","594":"What if one of them was light-fingered?","595":"Stole something; something from the hoard.","596":"Remind me ...","597":"... when was the last time that it rained?","598":"It\u2019s been here since Monday.","599":"No-one\u2019s been in that flat for at least three days.","600":"D\u2019you leave your windows open when you go on holiday?","601":"Someone else has been here.","602":"Somebody else broke into the flat and knocked over the vase just like I did.","603":"I\u2019m not the first.","604":"Somebody\u2019s been in here before me!","605":"Size eight feet.","606":"Small, but ... athletic.","607":"Small, strong hands.","608":"Our acrobat.","609":"But why didn\u2019t he close the window when he left ...?","610":"Oh, stupid. Stupid. Obvious. He\u2019s still here.","611":"John! John!","612":"The, uh, milk\u2019s gone off and the washing\u2019s starting to smell. Somebody left here in a hurry three days ago.","613":"Soo Lin Yao. We have to find her.","614":"Maybe we could start with this.","615":"I\u2019m fine.","616":"When was the last time that you saw her?","617":"What was the last thing that she did on her final afternoon?","618":"We have to get to Soo Lin Yao.","619":"Forget about your court date.","620":"If you wanna hide a tree in the middle of a forest, this is the best place to do it, wouldn\u2019t you say? People would just walk straight past, not knowing, unable to decipher the message.","621":"They have been in here.  And that\u2019s the exact same paint?","622":"John, if we\u2019re going to decipher this code, we\u2019re gonna need to look for more evidence.","623":"Somebody doesn\u2019t want me to see it.","624":"Shh, John, concentrate. I need you to concentrate. Close your eyes.","625":"I need you to maximise your visual memory. Try to picture what you saw. Can you picture it?","626":"Can you remember it?","627":"Can you remember the pattern?","628":"How much can you remember it?","629":"Because the average human memory on visual matters is only sixty-two percent accurate.","630":"Really?","631":"Always in pairs, John.","632":"Numbers come with partners.","633":"Why did he paint it so near the tracks?","634":"Thousands of people pass by there every day.","635":"Of course.","636":"Of course! He wants information. He\u2019s trying to communicate with his people in the underworld. Whatever was stolen, he wants it back.","637":"Somewhere here in the code.","638":"We can\u2019t crack this without Soo Lin Yao.","639":"Two men who travelled back from China were murdered, and their killer left them messages in the Hangzhou numerals.","640":"Tell me more about those teapots.","641":"Yesterday, only one of those pots was shining. Now there are two.","642":"Fancy a biscuit with that?","643":"Centuries old. Don\u2019t wanna break that.","644":"Hello.","645":"You\u2019ve been clever to avoid him so far.","646":"Who is he? Have you met him before?","647":"The cipher.","648":"The Spider.","649":"Yes. It\u2019s the mark of a Tong.","650":"Ancient crime syndicate based in China.","651":"Who are they?","652":"Then he came looking for you.","653":"Can you decipher these?","654":"Yes, I know.","655":"And this one is fifteen. But what\u2019s the code?","656":"Careful!","657":"Some of those skulls are over two hundred thousand years old! Have a bit of respect!","658":"Thank you.","659":"Brian Lukis and Eddie Van Coon were working for a gang of international smugglers \u2013 a gang called the Black Lotus operating here in London right under your nose.","660":"What are you thinking: pork or the pasta?","661":"This place is never going to trouble Egon Ronay, is it?","662":"I\u2019d stick with the pasta. Don\u2019t wanna be doing roast pork \u2013 not if you\u2019re slicing up cadavers.","663":"Don\u2019t eat when I\u2019m working. Digesting slows me down.","664":"Need to examine some bodies.","665":"Eddie Van Coon and Brian Lukis.","666":"Could you wheel them out again for me?","667":"You\u2019ve ... changed your hair.","668":"The-the style: it\u2019s usually parted in the middle.","669":"Mmm, it\u2019s good; it, um, suits you better this way.","670":"We\u2019re just interested in the feet.","671":"Yes. D\u2019you mind if we have a look at them?","672":"Now Van Coon.","673":"Oh.","674":"So either these two men just happened to visit the same Chinese tattoo parlour or I\u2019m telling the truth.","675":"I want every book from Lukis\u2019 apartment and Van Coon\u2019s.","676":"Not just a criminal organisation; it\u2019s a cult. Her brother was corrupted by one of its leaders.","677":"Yes, Shan; General Shan.","678":"Wrong. We\u2019ve got almost all we need to know. She gave us most of the missing pieces.","679":"Why did he need to visit his sister? Why did he need her expertise?","680":"Exactly.","681":"Valuable antiquities, John. Ancient Chinese relics purchased on the black market. China\u2019s home to a thousand treasures hidden after Mao\u2019s revolution.","682":"Check for the dates ...","683":"Here, John.","684":"Arrived from China four days ago.","685":"Anonymous. Vendor doesn\u2019t give his name. Two undiscovered treasures from the East.","686":"... antiquities sold at auction.","687":"Look, here\u2019s another one.","688":"Arrived from China a month ago: Chinese ceramic statue, sold four hundred thousand.","689":"All of them from an anonymous source. They\u2019re stealing them back in China and one by one they\u2019re feeding them into Britain.","690":"So what if one of them got greedy when they were in China? What if one of them stole something?","691":"What?","692":"So, the numbers are references.","693":"To specific pages and specific words on those pages.","694":"Turn to page fifteen and it\u2019s the first word you read.","695":"Depends on the book. That\u2019s the cunning of the book code. Has to be one that they both owned.","696":"Some silence right now would be marvellous.","697":"\u201cCigarette.\u201d","698":"\u201cImagine.\u201d","699":"A book that everybody would own.","700":"Fifteen. Entry one.","701":"I need to get some air. We\u2019re going out tonight.","702":"What?","703":"That\u2019s what I was suggesting.","704":"Where are you taking her?","705":"Oh, dull, boring, predictable.","706":"Why don\u2019t you try this?","707":"In London for one night only.","708":"And then I phoned back and got one for myself as well.","709":"I\u2019m Sherlock.","710":"Hello.","711":"Yellow Dragon Circus, in London for one day. It fits. The Tong sent an assassin to England ...","712":"We\u2019re looking for a killer who can climb, who can shin up a rope. Where else would you find that level of dexterity? Exit visas are scarce in China. They need a pretty good reason to get out of that country. Now, all I need to do is have a quick look round the place ...","713":"I need your help.","714":"Like what?","715":"What\u2019s so important?","716":"What?","717":"This is not their day job.","718":"Classic Chinese escapology act.","719":"The crossbow\u2019s on a delicate string. The warrior has to escape his bonds before it fires.","720":"She splits the sandbag; the sand pours out; gradually the weight lowers into the bowl.","721":"Well, well.","722":"Found you.","723":"Come on! Let\u2019s go!","724":"Look, I saw the mark at the circus \u2013 that tattoo that we saw on the two bodies: the mark of the Tong.","725":"These circus performers were gang members sent here to get it back.","726":"No, they won\u2019t leave without what they came for. We need to find their hide-out; the rendezvous.","727":"Somewhere in this message it must tell us.","728":"Yes, it would be better to study if you left now.","729":"Ooh, God.","730":"Consulting detective.","731":"They\u2019re numbers. An ancient Chinese dialect.","732":"Exactly.","733":"How did you know that?","734":"John.","735":"John, look at this.","736":"Soo Lin at the museum \u2013 she started to translate the code for us. We didn\u2019t see it!","737":"\u201cNINE\u201d \u201cMILL\u201d.","738":"Nine million quid. For what?","739":"We need to know the end of this sentence.","740":"To the museum; to the restoration room.","741":"Oh, we must have been staring right at it!","742":"The book, John. The book \u2013 the key to cracking the cipher!","743":"Soo Lin used it to do this! Whilst we were running around the gallery, she started to translate the code. It must be on her desk.","744":"Taxi!","745":"Entschuldigen Sie, bitte. [Forgive me, please.","746":"A book that everybody would own.","747":"Please, wait! Bitte! [Please!","748":"Minute! [Wait a minute!","749":"Page fifteen, entry one. Page fifteen, entry one ...","750":"Dead man. You were threatening to kill them.","751":"It\u2019s the first cipher.","752":"Thirty-seven, nine; thirty-seven, nine ...","753":"Nine mill ... for ...","754":"Sixty, thirty-five.","755":"Jade.  Jade.","756":"\u201cNINE MILL FOR JADE PIN DRAGON DEN BLACK ...  ... TRAMWAY.\u201d","757":"John! John! I\u2019ve got it!","758":"The cipher! The book! It\u2019s the London A to Z that they\u2019re using...","759":"Take my card.","760":"Tramway.","761":"Oh, Christ.","762":"There.","763":"You should, you know.","764":"Sherlock Holmes is nothing at all like him.","765":"How would you describe me, John? Resourceful? Dynamic? Enigmatic?","766":"That\u2019s a semi-automatic. If you fire it, the bullet will travel at over a thousand metres per second.","767":"Well ...","768":"... the radius curvature of these walls is nearly four metres. If you miss, the bullet will ricochet. Could hit anyone. Might even bounce off the tunnel and hit you.","769":"It\u2019s all right.","770":"You\u2019re gonna be all right. It\u2019s over now. It\u2019s over.","771":"We\u2019ll just slip off. No need to mention us in your report.","772":"I have high hopes for you, Inspector. A glittering career.","773":"Exactly.","774":"Million.","775":"An instruction to all their London operatives.","776":"A message; what they were trying to reclaim.","777":"Worth nine million pounds. Bring it to the Tramway, their London hideout.","778":"Apparently.","779":"Depends who owned it.","780":"Two operatives based in London. They travel over to Dalian to smuggle those vases. One of them helps himself to something: a little hairpin.","781":"Eddie Van Coon was the thief. He stole the treasure when he was in China.","782":"Because of the soap.","783":"He bought you a present.","784":"A little gift when he came back from China.","785":"You weren\u2019t just his P.A., were you?","786":"No.","787":"Scented hand soap in his apartment.","788":"Three hundred millilitres of it. Bottle almost finished.","789":"I don\u2019t think Eddie Van Coon was the type of chap to buy himself hand soap \u2013 not unless he had a lady coming over. And it\u2019s the same brand as that hand cream there on your desk.","790":"What happened? Why did you end it?","791":"And he brought you a present from abroad to say sorry.","792":"Can I ... just have a look at it?","793":"Oh, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. I think he pinched it.","794":"Didn\u2019t know its value; just thought it would suit you.","795":"Nine ... million ... pounds.","796":"He didn\u2019t know its value; didn\u2019t know why they were chasing him.","797":"Hmm.","798":"What?","799":"It must be a vast network, John; thousands of operatives. You and I, we barely scratched the surface.","800":"No. No. I cracked this code; all the smugglers have to do is pick up another book.","801":"Just tell me what happened, from the beginning.","802":"Wasn\u2019t a real man.","803":"It\u2019s not \u201cweren\u2019t\u201d; it\u2019s \u201cwasn\u2019t\u201d.","804":"Go on.","805":"\u201cTaught.\u201d","806":"Taught you how to cut up a beast.","807":"\u201cDid it.\u201d","808":"No, no, no, Mr. Berwick, not at all.","809":"Hanged, yes.","810":"Bored.","811":"Bored!","812":"Bored! Bored!","813":"Don\u2019t know what\u2019s got into the criminal classes. Good job I\u2019m not one of them.","814":"Ah, the wall had it coming.","815":"Belarus. Open and shut domestic murder. Not worth my time.","816":"Just tea for me, thanks.","817":"Yes.","818":"Well, where else was I supposed to put it?","819":"You don\u2019t mind, do you?","820":"I got it from Bart\u2019s morgue.","821":"I\u2019m measuring the coagulation of saliva after death.","822":"I see you\u2019ve written up the taxi driver case.","823":"\u201cA Study in Pink.\u201d Nice.","824":"Erm, no.","825":"Flattered?  \u201cSherlock sees through everything and everyone in seconds. What\u2019s incredible, though, is how spectacularly ignorant he is about some things.\u201d","826":"Oh, you meant \u201cspectacularly ignorant\u201d in a nice way Look, it doesn\u2019t matter to me who\u2019s Prime Minister ...","827":"... or who\u2019s sleeping with who ...","828":"Not that again. It\u2019s not important.","829":"Well, if I ever did, I\u2019ve deleted it.","830":"Listen.  This is my hard drive, and it only makes sense to put things in there that are useful ... really useful.","831":"Ordinary people fill their heads with all kinds of rubbish, and that makes it hard to get at the stuff that matters. Do you see?","832":"Oh, hell! What does that matter?!","833":"So we go round the Sun! If we went round the Moon, or round and round the garden like a teddy bear, it wouldn\u2019t make any difference. All that matters to me is the work. Without that, my brain rots.","834":"Put that in your blog. Or better still, stop inflicting your opinions on the world.","835":"Where are you going?","836":"Look at that, Mrs Hudson.  Quiet, calm, peaceful.  Isn\u2019t it hateful?","837":"Can\u2019t come too soon.","838":"John.","839":"Hmm? What?  Oh, yeah. Fine. Gas leak, apparently.","840":"I can\u2019t.","841":"The stuff I\u2019ve got on is just too big. I can\u2019t spare the time.","842":"How\u2019s the diet?","843":"If you\u2019re so keen, why don\u2019t you investigate it?","844":"How\u2019s Sarah, John? How was the lilo?","845":"Oh yes, of course.","846":"I\u2019d like to see you try.","847":"Why shouldn\u2019t I?","848":"Sherlock Holmes.","849":"Of course. How could I refuse?","850":"Lestrade. I\u2019ve been summoned. Coming?","851":"Of course.","852":"I\u2019d be lost without my blogger.","853":"Obviously.","854":"Gas leak, yes?","855":"No?","856":"You haven\u2019t opened it?","857":"How reassuring.","858":"Nice stationery. Bohemian.","859":"From the Czech Republic. No fingerprints?","860":"She used a fountain pen. A Parker Duofold \u2013 iridium nib.","861":"Obviously.","862":"Well, obviously it\u2019s not the same phone but it\u2019s supposed to look like ...","863":"The Study in Pink? You read his blog?","864":"It isn\u2019t the same phone. This one\u2019s brand new.","865":"Someone\u2019s gone to a lot of trouble to make it look like the same phone, which means your blog has a far wider readership.","866":"No. That\u2019s not it.","867":"It\u2019s a warning.","868":"Some secret societies used to send dried melon seeds, orange pips, things like that. Five pips. They\u2019re warning us it\u2019s gonna happen again.","869":"And I\u2019ve seen this place before.","870":"Boom!","871":"Mrs Hudson!","872":"The door\u2019s been opened recently.","873":"Hello?","874":"Who\u2019s this?","875":"Who\u2019s talking? Why are you crying?","876":"The curtain rises.","877":"Nothing.","878":"I\u2019ve been expecting this for some time.","879":"Hmm?","880":"Oh, she doesn\u2019t matter. She\u2019s just a hostage. No lead there.","881":"You\u2019re not going to be much use to her.","882":"The bomber\u2019s too smart for that.","883":"Pass me my phone.","884":"Jacket.","885":"Careful.","886":"Delete it.","887":"Missile plans are out of the country now. Nothing we can do about it.","888":"Then why didn\u2019t he cancel his dental appointment?","889":"Mycroft never texts if he can talk. Look, Andrew West stole the missile plans, tried to sell them, got his head smashed in for his pains. End of story. The only mystery is this: why is my brother so determined to bore me when somebody else is being so delightfully interesting?","890":"What for?","891":"This hospital\u2019s full of people dying, Doctor. Why don\u2019t you go and cry by their bedside and see what good it does them?","892":"Ah!","893":"Oh, yes!","894":"Gay.","895":"Nothing.  Um, hey.","896":"And domestic bliss must suit you, Molly. You\u2019ve put on three pounds since I last saw you.","897":"Nuh, three.","898":"With that level of personal grooming?","899":"You wash your hair. There\u2019s a difference. No-no \u2013 tinted eyelashes; clear signs of taurine cream around the frown lines; those tired clubber\u2019s eyes. Then there\u2019s his underwear.","900":"Visible above the waistline \u2013 very visible; very particular brand.","901":"That, plus the extremely suggestive fact that he just left his number under this dish here ...  ... and I\u2019d say you\u2019d better break it off now and save yourself the pain.","902":"Just saving her time. Isn\u2019t that kinder?","903":"Go on, then.","904":"You know what I do. Off you go.","905":"Go on.","906":"An outside eye, a second opinion. It\u2019s very useful to me.","907":"Really.","908":"Good.","909":"You\u2019re on sparkling form. What else?","910":"But ...?","911":"Excellent. What else?","912":"That\u2019s it?","913":"Well, John; really well.","914":"I mean, you missed almost everything of importance, but, um, you know ...","915":"The owner loved these. Scrubbed them clean, whitened them where they got discoloured. Changed the laces three ... no, four times.","916":"Even so, there are traces of his flaky skin where his fingers have come into contact with them, so he suffered from eczema. Shoes are well-worn, more so on the inside, which means the owner had weak arches. British-made, twenty years old.","917":"They\u2019re not retro \u2013 they\u2019re original.","918":"Limited edition: two blue stripes, nineteen eighty-nine.","919":"Someone\u2019s kept them that way. Quite a bit of mud caked on the soles. Analysis shows it\u2019s from Sussex, with London mud overlaying it.","920":"Pollen. Clear as a map reference to me.","921":"South of the river, too. So, the kid who owned these trainers came to London from Sussex twenty years ago and left them behind.","922":"Something bad.","923":"He loved those shoes, remember. He\u2019d never leave them filthy. Wouldn\u2019t leave them go unless he had to. So: a child with big feet gets ...","924":"Oh.","925":"Carl Powers.","926":"Carl Powers, John.","927":"It\u2019s where I began.","928":"Nineteen eighty-nine, a young kid \u2013 champion swimmer \u2013 came up from Brighton for a school sports tournament; drowned in the pool. Tragic accident.","929":"You wouldn\u2019t remember it. Why should you?","930":"Yes.","931":"Nobody thought so \u2013 nobody except me. I was only a kid myself. I read about it in the papers.","932":"The boy, Carl Powers, had some kind of fit in the water, but by the time they got him out it was too late. But there was something wrong; something I couldn\u2019t get out of my head.","933":"His shoes.","934":"They weren\u2019t there. I made a fuss; I tried to get the police interested, but nobody seemed to think it was important. He\u2019d left all the rest of his clothes in his locker, but there was no sign of his shoes ...","935":"... until now.","936":"Must be a root canal.","937":"How quaint.","938":"You are. Queen and country.","939":"I\u2019m not ignoring it. Putting my best man onto it right now.","940":"Poison.","941":"Clostridium botulinum!","942":"It\u2019s one of the deadliest poisons on the planet!","943":"Carl Powers!","944":"Remember the shoelaces?","945":"The boy suffered from eczema. It\u2019d be the easiest thing in the world to introduce the poison into his medication. Two hours later he comes up to London, the poison takes effect, paralyses the muscles and he drowns.","946":"It\u2019s virtually undetectable. Nobody would have been looking for it.","947":"But there were still tiny traces of it left inside the trainers from where he put the cream on his feet.","948":"That\u2019s why they had to go.","949":"Get his attention ...","950":"... stop the clock.","951":"Yes.  Meaning ...","952":"Where are you? Tell us where you are.","953":"And if she deviated by one word, the sniper would set her off.","954":"Oh. Elegant.","955":"Oh \u2013 I can\u2019t be the only person in the world that gets bored.","956":"First test passed, it would seem. Here\u2019s the second.","957":"It\u2019s abandoned, wouldn\u2019t you say?","958":"Hello?","959":"Who is this? Is this you again?","960":"And you\u2019ve stolen another voice, I presume.","961":"Who are you?","962":"What\u2019s that noise?","963":"No body.","964":"Get a sample sent to the lab.","965":"Mrs Monkford?","966":"Sherlock Holmes. Very old friend of your husband\u2019s. We, um ...","967":"... we grew up together.","968":"Oh, he must have done. This is ... this is horrible, isn\u2019t it?","969":"I mean, I just can\u2019t believe it. I only saw him the other day. Same old Ian \u2013 not a care in the world.","970":"Really strange that he hired a car. Why would he do that? It\u2019s a bit suspicious, isn\u2019t it?","971":"Oh, well, that was Ian! That was Ian all over!","972":"Wasn\u2019t it? Interesting.","973":"People don\u2019t like telling you things, but they love to contradict you. Past tense, did you notice?","974":"I referred to her husband in the past tense. She joined in. Bit premature \u2013 they\u2019ve only just found the car.","975":"Definitely not. That\u2019s not a mistake a murderer would make.","976":"Janus Cars.","977":"Just found this in the glove compartment.","978":"Is that one?","979":"But, er, surely you can afford one \u2013 a Mazda, I mean?","980":"Nice holiday, Mr. Ewert?","981":"You\u2019ve been away, haven\u2019t you?","982":"Have you got any change for the cigarette machine?","983":"Well, I noticed one on the way in and I haven\u2019t got any change.","984":"I\u2019m gasping.","985":"Oh well. Thank you very much for your time, Mr. Ewert.","986":"You\u2019ve been very helpful. Come on, John.","987":"Nicotine patches, remember? I\u2019m doing well.","988":"I needed to look inside his wallet.","989":"Mr. Ewert\u2019s a liar.","990":"Hello?","991":"Why would you be giving me a clue?","992":"Then talk to me in your own voice.","993":"How much blood was on that seat, would you say?","994":"Not \u2018about\u2019. Exactly a pint. That was their first mistake. The blood\u2019s definitely Ian Monkford\u2019s but it\u2019s been frozen.","995":"There are clear signs. I think Ian Monkford gave a pint of his blood some time ago and that\u2019s what they spread on the seats.","996":"Janus Cars. The clue\u2019s in the name.","997":"Exactly.","998":"They provide a very special service. If you\u2019ve got any kind of a problem \u2013 money troubles, bad marriage, whatever \u2013 Janus Cars will help you disappear. Ian Monkford was up to his eyes in some kind of trouble \u2013 financial, at a guess; he\u2019s a banker. Couldn\u2019t see a way out. But if he were to vanish, if the car he hired was found abandoned with his blood all over the driver\u2019s seat ...","999":"Columbia.","1000":"Mr. Ewert of Janus Cars had a twenty thousand Columbian peso note in his wallet ...","1001":"... Quite a bit of change, too. He told us he hadn\u2019t been abroad recently, but when I asked him about the cars, I could see his tan line clearly.","1002":"No-one wears a shirt on a sunbed. That, plus his arm.","1003":"Kept scratching it. Obviously irritating him, and bleeding.","1004":"Why? Because he\u2019d recently had a booster jab. Hep-B, probably. Difficult to tell at that distance. Conclusion: he\u2019d just come back from settling Ian Monkford into his new life in Columbia. Mrs Monkford cashes in the life insurance and she splits it with Janus Cars.","1005":"Oh yes. She\u2019s in on it too.","1006":"Now go and arrest them, Inspector. That\u2019s what you do best.","1007":"We need to let our friendly bomber know that the case is solved.","1008":"I am on fire!","1009":"Feeling better?","1010":"Probably.","1011":"Yes, I know.","1012":"Perhaps.","1013":"That could be anybody.","1014":"How d\u2019you mean?","1015":"Hello?","1016":"Why are you doing this?","1017":"No.","1018":"Not any more. So: dead two days. According to one of her staff, Raoul de Santos, she cut her hand on a rusty nail in the garden. Nasty wound.","1019":"Tetanus bacteria enters the bloodstream \u2013 good night Vienna.","1020":"Something\u2019s wrong with this picture.","1021":"Can\u2019t be as simple as it seems, otherwise the bomber wouldn\u2019t be directing us towards it. Something\u2019s wrong.","1022":"John?","1023":"The cut on her hand: it\u2019s deep; would have bled a lot, right?","1024":"But the wound\u2019s clean \u2013 very clean, and fresh.","1025":"How long would the bacteria have been incubating inside her?","1026":"Must have been. The only question is, how did the tetanus enter the dead woman\u2019s system?","1027":"You want to help, right?","1028":"Connie Prince\u2019s background \u2013 family history, everything. Give me data.","1029":"Is there?","1030":"Good Samaritan.","1031":"Bad Samaritan.","1032":"Something new.","1033":"Connection, connection, connection. There must be a connection.","1034":"Carl Powers, killed twenty years ago. The bomber knew him; admitted that he knew him. The bomber\u2019s iPhone was in stationery from the Czech Republic. First hostage from Cornwall; the second from London; the third from Yorkshire, judging by her accent. What\u2019s he doing \u2013 working his way round the world? Showing off?","1035":"Great. ... Thank you. Thanks again.","1036":"Home Office.","1037":"Well, Home Secretary, actually. Owes me a favour.","1038":"Not until now.","1039":"So I gather. I\u2019ve just been having a very fruitful chat with people who loved this show. Fan sites \u2013 indispensible for gossip.","1040":"John.","1041":"I\u2019ll remember.","1042":"Ah, Mr. Prince, isn\u2019t it?","1043":"Very good to meet you.","1044":"So sorry to hear about ...","1045":"Oh yes?","1046":"Oh, who\u2019s this?","1047":"How nice Was she Connie\u2019s?","1048":"Oh, um ...","1049":"Two point eight.","1050":"Sorry.","1051":"What?","1052":"You think it was the cat. It wasn\u2019t the cat.","1053":"Lovely idea.","1054":"I thought of it the minute I saw the scratches on her arm, but it\u2019s too random and too clever for the brother.","1055":"Did he?","1056":"No. It was revenge.","1057":"Raoul, the houseboy. Kenny Prince was the butt of his sister\u2019s jokes, week in, week out, a virtual bullying campaign. Finally he had enough; fell out with her badly. It\u2019s all on the website. She threatened to disinherit Kenny. Raoul had grown accustomed to a certain lifestyle, so ...","1058":"Raoul keeps a very clean house. You came through the kitchen door, saw the state of that floor, scrubbed to within an inch of its life. You smell of disinfectant now. No, the cat doesn\u2019t come into it.","1059":"Raoul\u2019s internet records do, though. Hope we can get a cab from here.","1060":"Raoul de Santos is your killer. Kenny Prince\u2019s houseboy. Second autopsy shows it wasn\u2019t tetanus that poisoned Connie Prince \u2013 it was botulinum toxin.","1061":"We\u2019ve been here before. Carl Powers? Tut-tut. Our bomber\u2019s repeated himself.","1062":"Botox injection.","1063":"Botox is a diluted form of botulinum. Among other things, Raoul de Santos was employed to give Connie her regular facial injections. My contact at the Home Office gave me the complete records of Raoul\u2019s internet purchases.  He\u2019s been bulk ordering Botox for months.","1064":"Bided his time, then upped the strength to a fatal dose.","1065":"I\u2019m sure.","1066":"What?","1067":"Well, this one was quite simple, actually, and like I said, the bomber repeated himself. That was a mistake.","1068":"I knew I could save her. I also knew that the bomber had given us twelve hours. I solved the case quickly; that gave me time to get on with other things. Don\u2019t you see? We\u2019re one up on him!","1069":"Hello?","1070":"Tell us where you are. Address.","1071":"No, no, no, no. Tell me nothing about him. Nothing.","1072":"Hello?","1073":"Well, obviously I lost that round \u2013 although technically I did solve the case.","1074":"He killed the old lady because she started to describe him.","1075":"Just once, he put himself in the firing line.","1076":"Well, usually, he must stay above it all. He organises these things but no-one ever has direct contact.","1077":"Novel.","1078":"Taking his time this time.","1079":"Nothing. All the living classmates check out spotless. No connection.","1080":"The thought had occurred.","1081":"I think he wants to be distracted.","1082":"Sorry, what?","1083":"Will caring about them help save them?","1084":"Then I\u2019ll continue not to make that mistake.","1085":"Yes, very. Is that news to you?","1086":"I\u2019ve disappointed you.","1087":"Don\u2019t make people into heroes, John. Heroes don\u2019t exist, and if they did, I wouldn\u2019t be one of them.","1088":"Excellent!","1089":"View of the Thames. South Bank \u2013 somewhere between Southwark Bridge and Waterloo.","1090":"You check the papers; I\u2019ll look online ...","1091":"Oh, you\u2019re angry with me, so you won\u2019t help.","1092":"Not much cop, this caring lark.","1093":"Ten a penny.","1094":"Nothing!","1095":"It\u2019s me. Have you found anything on the South Bank between Waterloo Bridge and Southwark Bridge?","1096":"Must be. Odd, though ...  ... he hasn\u2019t been in touch.","1097":"Yes.","1098":"Seven ... so far.","1099":"Fingertips.","1100":"He\u2019s been in the river a long while. The water\u2019s destroyed most of the data.","1101":"But I\u2019ll tell you one thing: that lost Vermeer painting\u2019s a fake.","1102":"We need to identify the corpse. Find out about his friends and associates ...","1103":"It\u2019s all over the place. Haven\u2019t you seen the posters? Dutch Old Master, supposed to have been destroyed centuries ago; now it\u2019s turned up. Worth thirty million pounds.","1104":"Everything. Have you ever heard of the Golem?","1105":"Jewish folk story. A gigantic man made of clay. It\u2019s also the name of an assassin \u2013 real name Oskar Dzundza \u2013 one of the deadliest assassins in the world.","1106":"That is his trademark style.","1107":"Definitely. The Golem squeezes the life out of his victims with his bare hands.","1108":"You do see \u2013 you just don\u2019t observe.","1109":"What do we know about this corpse? The killer\u2019s not left us with much \u2013 just the shirt and the trousers. They\u2019re pretty formal \u2013 maybe he was going out for the night, but the trousers are heavy-duty, polyester, nasty, same as the shirt \u2013 cheap. They\u2019re both too big for him, so some kind of standard-issue uniform. Dressed for work, then. What kind of work? There\u2019s a hook on his belt for a walkie-talkie.","1110":"More likely. That\u2019ll be borne out by his backside.","1111":"Flabby. You\u2019d think that he\u2019d led a sedentary life, yet the soles of his feet and the nascent varicose veins in his legs show otherwise. So, a lot of walking and a lot of sitting around. Security guard\u2019s looking good. And the watch helps, too. The alarm shows he did regular night shifts.","1112":"No-no-no, the buttons are stiff, hardly touched. He set his alarm like that a long time ago. His routine never varied. But there\u2019s something else. The killer must have been interrupted, otherwise he would have stripped the corpse completely. There was some kind of badge or insignia on the shirt front that he tore off, suggesting the dead man worked somewhere recognisable, some kind of institution.","1113":"Found this inside his trouser pockets.","1114":"Sodden by the river but still recognisably ...","1115":"Ticket stubs. He worked in a museum or gallery. Did a quick check \u2013 the Hickman Gallery has reported one of its attendants as missing.","1116":"Alex Woodbridge. Tonight they unveil the re-discovered masterpiece. Now why would anyone want to pay the Golem to suffocate a perfectly ordinary gallery attendant? Inference: the dead man knew something about it \u2013 something that would stop the owner getting paid thirty million pounds. The picture\u2019s a fake.","1117":"Meretricious.","1118":"Pointless. You\u2019ll never find him. But I know a man who can.","1119":"Me.","1120":"Why hasn\u2019t he phoned? He\u2019s broken his pattern. Why?","1121":"Waterloo Bridge.","1122":"In a bit.","1123":"Dunno. Dangerous to jump to conclusions. Need data.","1124":"Stop!","1125":"You wait here. I won\u2019t be a moment.","1126":"What for?","1127":"Here you go \u2013 fifty.","1128":"Investing.","1129":"Now we go to the Gallery.","1130":"Have you got any cash?","1131":"No. I need you to find out all you can about the gallery attendant. Lestrade will give you the address.","1132":"Just admiring the view.","1133":"Doesn\u2019t it bother you?","1134":"That the painting\u2019s a fake.","1135":"It\u2019s a fake. It has to be. It\u2019s the only possible explanation.","1136":"You\u2019re in charge, aren\u2019t you, Miss Wenceslas?","1137":"Alex Woodbridge knew that the painting was a fake, so somebody sent the Golem to take care of him. Was it you?","1138":"Or are you working for someone else? Did you fake it for them?","1139":"It is a fake. Don\u2019t know why, but there\u2019s something wrong with it. There has to be.","1140":"Not a problem.","1141":"No. I don\u2019t work here, you see. Just popped in to give you a bit of friendly advice.","1142":"Please.","1143":"The art of disguise is knowing how to hide in plain sight.","1144":"Sherlock Holmes.","1145":"You should be.","1146":"Have a nice day!","1147":"And?","1148":"Is that it? No habits, hobbies, personality?","1149":"Hold that cab.","1150":"Don\u2019t mind if I do.","1151":"Fortunately, I haven\u2019t been idle.","1152":"Come on.","1153":"Beautiful, isn\u2019t it?","1154":"Doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t appreciate it.","1155":"This way.","1156":"Homeless network \u2013 really is indispensible.","1157":"My eyes and ears all over the city.","1158":"Yes, then I disinfect myself.","1159":"Come on!","1160":"Well, he has a very distinctive look. He has to hide somewhere where tongues won\u2019t wag \u2013 much.","1161":"What?","1162":"Don\u2019t mention it.","1163":"No, no, no, no! It\u2019ll take us weeks to find him again.","1164":"What?","1165":"Golem!","1166":"John!","1167":"Who are you working for this time, Dzundza?","1168":"It\u2019s a fake. It has to be.","1169":"It\u2019s a very good fake, then.","1170":"You know about this, don\u2019t you? This is you, isn\u2019t it?","1171":"The painting is a fake.","1172":"It\u2019s a fake. That\u2019s why Woodbridge and Cairns were killed.","1173":"Oh, come on. Proving it\u2019s just the detail. The painting is a fake. I\u2019ve solved it. I\u2019ve figured it out. It\u2019s a fake! That\u2019s the answer. That\u2019s why they were killed.","1174":"Okay, I\u2019ll prove it. Give me time. Will you give me time?","1175":"\u201cTen.\u201d","1176":"It\u2019s a countdown. He\u2019s giving me time.","1177":"The painting is a fake, but how can I prove it? How? How?","1178":"This kid will die. Tell me why the painting is a fake. Tell me!","1179":"No, shut up. Don\u2019t say anything. It only works if I figure it out.","1180":"Must be possible. Must be staring me in the face.","1181":"Woodbridge knew, but how?","1182":"Oh!","1183":"In the planetarium! You heard it too. Oh, that is brilliant! That is gorgeous!","1184":"This is beautiful. I love this!","1185":"The Van Buren Supernova!","1186":"There you go. Go find out where he is and pick him up.","1187":"The Van Buren Supernova, so-called.  Exploding star, only appeared in the sky in eighteen fifty-eight.","1188":"You know, it\u2019s interesting. Bohemian stationery, an assassin named after a Prague legend, and you, Miss Wenceslas. This whole case has a distinctly Czech feeling about it. Is that where this leads?","1189":"What are we looking at, Inspector?","1190":"Hmm!","1191":"Who?","1192":"And did those whispers have a name?","1193":"Points.","1194":"Knew you\u2019d get there eventually. West wasn\u2019t killed here; that\u2019s why there was so little blood.","1195":"Since the start. You don\u2019t think I\u2019d give up on a case like this just to spite my brother, do you?","1196":"Come on. Got a bit of burglary to do.","1197":"The missile defence plans haven\u2019t left the country, otherwise Mycroft\u2019s people would have heard about it. Despite what people think, we do still have a Secret Service.","1198":"Which means whoever stole the memory stick can\u2019t sell it or doesn\u2019t know what to do with it. My money\u2019s on the latter. We\u2019re here.","1199":"There isn\u2019t.","1200":"Oh, sorry, didn\u2019t I say? Joe Harrison\u2019s flat.","1201":"Brother of West\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.","1202":"He stole the memory stick; killed his prospective brother-in-law.","1203":"Let\u2019s ask him.","1204":"But stealing the plans for the missile defence programme wasn\u2019t an accident, was it?","1205":"When a neat little idea popped into your head.","1206":"Carrying Andrew West way away from here. His body would have gone on for ages if the train hadn\u2019t met a stretch of track that curved.","1207":"Exactly.","1208":"Fetch it for me \u2013 if you wouldn\u2019t mind.","1209":"Distraction over, the game continues.","1210":"Five pips, remember, John? It\u2019s a countdown. We\u2019ve only had four.","1211":"No, no, no! Of course he\u2019s not the boy\u2019s father!  Look at the turn-ups on his jeans!","1212":"Hmm?","1213":"Hmm. Not a patch on Connie Prince.","1214":"Yep. He was over the moon. Threatened me with a knighthood \u2013 again.","1215":"Hmm?","1216":"Didn\u2019t do you any good, did it?","1217":"True.","1218":"Mmm!","1219":"I\u2019ll get some.","1220":"Really.","1221":"Mmm.","1222":"Brought you a little getting-to-know-you present. Oh, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all been for, hasn\u2019t it? All your little puzzles; making me dance \u2013 all to distract me from this.","1223":"John. What the hell ...?","1224":"Stop it.","1225":"Who are you?","1226":"Both.","1227":"\u201cDear Jim. Please will you fix it for me to get rid of my lover\u2019s nasty sister?\u201d","1228":"\u201cDear Jim. Please will you fix it for me to disappear to South America?\u201d","1229":"Consulting criminal.  Brilliant.","1230":"I did.","1231":"Thank you.","1232":"Yes you did.","1233":"People have died.","1234":"I will stop you.","1235":"You all right?","1236":"Take it.","1237":"Oh, let me guess: I get killed.","1238":"I have been reliably informed that I don\u2019t have one.","1239":"What if I was to shoot you now \u2013 right now?","1240":"Catch ... you ... later.","1241":"All right?","1242":"Are you all right?","1243":"Me? Yeah, I\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine. Fine.","1244":"That, er ... thing that you, er, that you did; that, um ...  ... you offered to do. That was, um ... good.","1245":"Hmm?","1246":"People do little else.","1247":"Probably my answer has crossed yours.","1248":"No, no, please. You\u2019ve got the rest of your life.","1249":"Oh. Did you get a better offer?","1250":"Someone changed his mind. The question is: who?","1251":"What are you typing?","1252":"About?","1253":"You mean me.","1254":"Well, you\u2019re typing a lot.","1255":"Right then.  So, what have we got?","1256":"Boring.","1257":"Yes.","1258":"Leave.","1259":"Boring.","1260":"Oh. Interesting.","1261":"Geek interpreter. What\u2019s that?","1262":"What does it need a title for?","1263":"Do people actually read your blog?","1264":"I have a website.","1265":"Oh, for God\u2019s sakes!","1266":"\u201cThe Speckled Blonde\u201d?!","1267":"People don\u2019t really go to heaven when they die. They\u2019re taken to a special room and burned.","1268":"Suspected terrorist bomb. We do watch the news.","1269":"Eight, so far.","1270":"Okay, four ideas.","1271":"Maybe two ideas.","1272":"No, no, no, don\u2019t mention the unsolved ones.","1273":"Why?","1274":"No they\u2019re not. Why are they?","1275":"Sorry, what?","1276":"Two hundred and forty-three.","1277":"So, what\u2019s this one? \u201cBelly Button Murders\u201d?","1278":"Eurgh!","1279":"Well, they won\u2019t be interested in us.","1280":"For God\u2019s sake!","1281":"John.","1282":"Cover your face and walk fast.","1283":"I\u2019m a private detective. The last thing I need is a public image.","1284":"Tell us from the start. Don\u2019t be boring.","1285":"It\u2019s okay, I\u2019m fine.","1286":"Now, show me to the stream.","1287":"Look, this is a six.","1288":"There\u2019s no point in my leaving the flat for anything less than a seven. We agreed. Now, go back. Show me the grass.","1289":"We agreed it yesterday. Stop!","1290":"Closer.","1291":"Well, it\u2019s hardly my fault you weren\u2019t listening.","1292":"SHUT UP!","1293":"I don\u2019t know. How often are you away? Now, show me the car that backfired.","1294":"That\u2019s the one that made the noise, yes?","1295":"Oh, forget him. He\u2019s an idiot. Why else would he think himself a suspect?","1296":"Pass me over.","1297":"Up a bit! I\u2019m not talking from down \u2019ere!","1298":"Having driven to an isolated location and successfully committed a crime without a single witness, why would he then call the police and consult a detective? Fair play?","1299":"Did you see him? Morbidly obese, the undisguised halitosis of a single man living on his own, the right sleeve of an internet porn addict and the breathing pattern of an untreated heart condition. Low self-esteem, tiny IQ and a limited life expectancy \u2013 and you think he\u2019s an audacious criminal mastermind?!","1300":"Don\u2019t worry \u2013 this is just stupid.","1301":"Go to the stream.","1302":"Go and see.","1303":"Who the hell are you?","1304":"Oh, I know exactly where I\u2019m going.","1305":"No.","1306":"I don\u2019t know.","1307":"Oh, apparently yes.","1308":"I was in the middle of a case, Mycroft.","1309":"Transparent.","1310":"What for?","1311":"And my client is?","1312":"I take the precaution of a good coat and a short friend.","1313":"Mycroft, I don\u2019t do anonymous clients. I\u2019m used to mystery at one end of my cases. Both ends is too much work.","1314":"Good morning.","1315":"Get off my sheet!","1316":"Or I\u2019ll just walk away.","1317":"Who. Is. My. Client?","1318":"And there is a whole childhood in a nutshell.","1319":"Why? You have a police force of sorts, even a marginally Secret Service. Why come to me?","1320":"Not, to date, anyone with a Navy.","1321":"Nothing whatsoever.","1322":"You know I don\u2019t concern myself with trivia. Who is she?","1323":"Dominatrix.","1324":"Sex doesn\u2019t alarm me.","1325":"And I assume this Adler woman has some compromising photographs.","1326":"Hardly a difficult deduction. Photographs of whom?","1327":"How many photographs?","1328":"Do Miss Adler and this young female person appear in these photographs together?","1329":"And I assume in a number of compromising scenarios.","1330":"John, you might want to put that cup back in your saucer now.","1331":"How?","1332":"What case? Pay her, now and in full. As Miss Adler remarks in her masthead, \u201cKnow when you are beaten\u201d.","1333":"Oh, a power play. A power play with the most powerful family in Britain. Now that is a dominatrix. Ooh, this is getting rather fun, isn\u2019t it?","1334":"Hmm.","1335":"Where is she?","1336":"Text me the details. I\u2019ll be in touch by the end of the day.","1337":"No, I think I\u2019ll have the photographs.","1338":"I\u2019ll need some equipment, of course.","1339":"Can I have a box of matches?","1340":"Or your cigarette lighter. Either will do.","1341":"No, I know you don\u2019t, but your employer does.","1342":"I\u2019m not the Commonwealth.","1343":"Laters!","1344":"The evidence was right under your nose, John. As ever, you see but do not observe.","1345":"The ashtray.","1346":"Going into battle, John. I need the right armour.","1347":"No.","1348":"We know her address.","1349":"Exactly.","1350":"Just here, please.","1351":"Then it\u2019s time to add a splash of colour.","1352":"Two streets away, but this\u2019ll do.","1353":"Punch me in the face.","1354":"Yes. Punch me, in the face.  Didn\u2019t you hear me?","1355":"Oh, for God\u2019s sakes.","1356":"Thank you. That was \u2013 that was ...","1357":"Okay! I think we\u2019re done now, John.","1358":"You were a doctor!","1359":"Ooh! Um, sorry to disturb you. Um, I\u2019ve just been attacked, um, and, um, I think they ... they took my wallet and, um, and my phone. Umm, please could you help me?","1360":"Thank you, thank you! Could you, please?","1361":"Oh, would you ... would you mind if I just waited here, just until they come? Thank you. Thank you so much.","1362":"Thank you.  Er, ooh!","1363":"Oh! Thank you!","1364":"The photographs are perfectly safe.","1365":"She\u2019s not interested in blackmail. She wants ... protection for some reason. I take it you\u2019ve stood down the police investigation into the shooting at her house?","1366":"She\u2019d applaud your choice of words. You see how this works: that camera phone is her \u201cGet out of jail free\u201d card. You have to leave her alone. Treat her like royalty, Mycroft.","1367":"Text.","1368":"Did you know there were other people after her too, Mycroft, before you sent John and I in there? CIA-trained killers, at an excellent guess.","1369":"MYCROFT!","1370":"Though do, in fact, shut up.","1371":"There\u2019s nothing you can do and nothing she will do as far as I can see.","1372":"Why bother? You can follow her on Twitter. I believe her user name is \u201cTheWhipHand\u201d.","1373":"What noise?","1374":"It\u2019s a text alert. It means I\u2019ve got a text.","1375":"Well, somebody got hold of the phone and apparently, as a joke, personalised their text alert noise.","1376":"It would seem so.","1377":"I\u2019ll leave you to your deductions.","1378":"Where do you get that idea?","1379":"What else does she have?","1380":"Irene Adler. The Americans wouldn\u2019t be interested in her for a couple of compromising photographs. There\u2019s more.","1381":"Much more.","1382":"Something big\u2019s coming, isn\u2019t it?","1383":"Oh, will I?","1384":"Do give her my love.","1385":"Some things are best left to the imagination, Mrs Hudson.","1386":"No thank you, Sarah.","1387":"No-no-no, I can get this.","1388":"No, Sarah was the doctor; and then there was the one with the spots; and then the one with the nose; and then ... who was after the boring teacher?","1389":"Jeanette!  Ah, process of elimination.","1390":"Oh, dear Lord.","1391":"Oh, everybody\u2019s saying hullo to each other. How wonderful.","1392":"No stopping them, apparently.","1393":"John?","1394":"The counter on your blog: still says one thousand eight hundred and ninety-five.","1395":"And you\u2019ve got a photograph of me wearing that hat!","1396":"No they don\u2019t. What people?","1397":"Don\u2019t make jokes, Molly.","1398":"No, she\u2019s sleeping with a P.E. teacher.","1399":"Nope.","1400":"I see you\u2019ve got a new boyfriend, Molly, and you\u2019re serious about him.","1401":"In fact, you\u2019re seeing him this very night and giving him a gift.","1402":"Oh, come on. Surely you\u2019ve all seen the present at the top of the bag \u2013 perfectly wrapped with a bow. All the others are slapdash at best.","1403":"It\u2019s for someone special, then.","1404":"The shade of red echoes her lipstick \u2013 either an unconscious association or one that she\u2019s deliberately trying to encourage. Either way, Miss Hooper has lurrrve on her mind. The fact that she\u2019s serious about him is clear from the fact she\u2019s giving him a gift at all.","1405":"That would suggest long-term hopes, however forlorn; and that she\u2019s seeing him tonight is evident from her make-up and what she\u2019s wearing.","1406":"Obviously trying to compensate for the size of her mouth and breasts ...","1407":"I am sorry. Forgive me.","1408":"Merry Christmas, Molly Hooper.","1409":"No, it was me.","1410":"My phone.","1411":"Sorry, what?","1412":"Thrilling that you\u2019ve been counting.","1413":"\u2019Scuse me.","1414":"I said excuse me.","1415":"I think you\u2019re going to find Irene Adler tonight.","1416":"No, I mean you\u2019re going to find her dead.","1417":"Yes.","1418":"You didn\u2019t need to come in, Molly.","1419":"Show me the rest of her.","1420":"That\u2019s her.","1421":"Why?","1422":"Smoking indoors \u2013 isn\u2019t there one of those ... one of those law things?","1423":"She had an item in her possession, one she said her life depended on. She chose to give it up.","1424":"Look at them. They all care so much. Do you ever wonder if there\u2019s something wrong with us?","1425":"This is low tar.","1426":"Huh!","1427":"Merry Christmas, Mycroft.","1428":"Hope you didn\u2019t mess up my sock index this time.","1429":"Helps me to think.","1430":"The counter on your blog is still stuck at one thousand eight hundred and ninety-five.","1431":"Faulty \u2013 or you\u2019ve been hacked and it\u2019s a message.","1432":"Just faulty.","1433":"Don\u2019t snivel, Mrs Hudson. It\u2019ll do nothing to impede the flight of a bullet.","1434":"What a tender world that would be.","1435":"Then why don\u2019t you ask for it?","1436":"I believe I do.","1437":"First, get rid of your boys.","1438":"I dislike being outnumbered. It makes for too much stupid in the room.","1439":"Then get into the car and drive away.  Don\u2019t try to trick me. You know who I am. It doesn\u2019t work.","1440":"Next, you can stop pointing that gun at me.","1441":"I\u2019m unarmed.","1442":"Oh, I insist.","1443":"Moron.","1444":"You\u2019re all right now, you\u2019re all right.","1445":"Mrs Hudson\u2019s been attacked by an American. I\u2019m restoring balance to the universe.","1446":"Downstairs. Take her downstairs and look after her.","1447":"I expect so. Now go.","1448":"Lestrade. We\u2019ve had a break-in at Baker Street. Send your least irritating officers and an ambulance.  Oh, no-no-no-no-no, we\u2019re fine. No, it\u2019s the, uh, it\u2019s the burglar. He\u2019s got himself rather badly injured.","1449":"Oh, a few broken ribs, fractured skull ... suspected punctured lung.","1450":"He fell out of a window.","1451":"It\u2019s all a bit of a blur, Detective Inspector. I lost count.","1452":"Of course, but she\u2019s fine.","1453":"Don\u2019t be absurd.","1454":"Safest place I know.","1455":"Thank you.","1456":"Shame on you, John Watson.","1457":"Mrs Hudson leave Baker Street?","1458":"England would fall.","1459":"Where no-one will look.","1460":"Yes, it is.","1461":"Happy New Year, John.","1462":"It\u2019s a camera phone.","1463":"Yes, I am.","1464":"A woman\u2019s.","1465":"You think she\u2019s my girlfriend because I\u2019m X-raying her possessions?","1466":"Yes.","1467":"They do, don\u2019t they? Very silly.","1468":"She sent this to my address, and she loves to play games.","1469":"We have a client.","1470":"So who\u2019s after you?","1471":"Who\u2019s that?","1472":"So you faked your own death in order to get ahead of them.","1473":"Except you let John know that you were alive, and therefore me.","1474":"You couldn\u2019t.","1475":"If they\u2019ve been watching me, they\u2019ll know that I took a safety deposit box at a bank on the Strand a few months ago.","1476":"Very good, John. Excellent plan, with intelligent precautions.","1477":"So what do you keep on here \u2013 in general, I mean?","1478":"So how do you acquire this information?","1479":"But you\u2019ve acquired something that\u2019s more danger than protection. Do you know what it is?","1480":"I assumed. Show me.","1481":"The passcode.","1482":"No, because it\u2019s a duplicate that I had made, into which you\u2019ve just entered the numbers one oh five eight.","1483":"I assumed you\u2019d choose something more specific than that but, um, thanks anyway.","1484":"Oh, you\u2019re rather good.","1485":"Yes.","1486":"There\u2019s a margin for error but I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a Seven Forty-Seven leaving Heathrow tomorrow at six thirty in the evening for Baltimore. Apparently it\u2019s going to save the world. Not sure how that can be true but give me a moment; I\u2019ve only been on the case for eight seconds.","1487":"Oh, come on. It\u2019s not code. These are seat allocations on a passenger jet. Look: there\u2019s no letter \u2018I\u2019 because it can be mistaken for a \u20181\u2019; no letters past \u2018K\u2019 \u2013 the width of the plane is the limit. The numbers always appear randomly and not in sequence but the letters have little runs of sequence all over the place \u2013 families and couples sitting together. Only a Jumbo is wide enough to need the letter \u2018K\u2019 or rows past fifty-five, which is why there\u2019s always an upstairs. There\u2019s a row thirteen, which eliminates the more superstitious airlines. Then there\u2019s the style of the flight number \u2013 zero zero seven \u2013 that eliminates a few more; and assuming a British point of origin, which would be logical considering the original source of the information and assuming from the increased pressure on you lately that the crisis is imminent, the only flight that matches all the criteria and departs within the week is the six thirty to Baltimore tomorrow evening from Heathrow Airport.","1488":"Please don\u2019t feel obliged to tell me that was remarkable or amazing. John\u2019s expressed the same thought in every possible variant available to the English language.","1489":"John, please can you check those flight schedules; see if I\u2019m right?","1490":"I\u2019ve never begged for mercy in my life.","1491":"What did you say?","1492":"No, no, no, after that. What did you say after that?","1493":"Double oh seven, double oh seven, double oh seven, double oh seven ...","1494":"... something ... something connected to double oh seven ... What?","1495":"Double oh seven, double oh seven, what, what, something, what?","1496":"Coventry.","1497":"Where\u2019s John?","1498":"I was just talking to him.","1499":"It\u2019s a story, probably not true. In the Second World War, the Allies knew that Coventry was going to get bombed because they\u2019d broken the German code but they didn\u2019t want the Germans to know that they\u2019d broken the code, so they let it happen anyway.","1500":"Sorry?","1501":"I don\u2019t understand.","1502":"Why?","1503":"I\u2019m not.","1504":"Why would I want to have dinner if I wasn\u2019t hungry?","1505":"That\u2019s not the end of the world; that\u2019s Mrs Hudson.","1506":"Have you come to take me away again?","1507":"Well, I decline.","1508":"There\u2019s going to be a bomb on a passenger jet. The British and American governments know about it but rather than expose the source of that information they\u2019re going to let it happen. The plane will blow up. Coventry all over again. The wheel turns. Nothing is ever new.","1509":"Well, you\u2019re lookin\u2019 all better. How ya feelin\u2019?","1510":"The plane blows up mid-air. Mission accomplished for the terrorists. Hundreds of casualties, but nobody dies.","1511":"How\u2019s the plane going to fly?  Of course: unmanned aircraft. Hardly new.","1512":"Your MOD man.","1513":"Hmm. You should screen your defence people more carefully.","1514":"Don\u2019t be absurd.","1515":"So do I. There are a number of aspects I\u2019m still not quite clear on.","1516":"There are four additional units wired inside the casing, I suspect containing acid or a small amount of explosive.","1517":"Any attempt to open the casing will burn the hard drive.","1518":"There will be two passcodes: one to open the phone, one to burn the drive. Even under duress you can\u2019t know which one she\u2019s given you and there will be no point in a second attempt.","1519":"No.","1520":"I said no. Very very close, but no.","1521":"You got carried away. The game was too elaborate. You were enjoying yourself too much.","1522":"Oh, enjoying the thrill of the chase is fine, craving the distraction of the game \u2013 I sympathise entirely \u2013 but sentiment? Sentiment is a chemical defect found in the losing side.","1523":"You.","1524":"No.","1525":"Because I took your pulse.","1526":"Elevated; your pupils dilated.","1527":"I imagine John Watson thinks love\u2019s a mystery to me but the chemistry is incredibly simple, and very destructive.","1528":"When we first met, you told me that disguise is always a self-portrait. How true of you: the combination to your safe \u2013 your measurements; but this ...  ... this is far more intimate.","1529":"This is your heart ...","1530":"... and you should never let it rule your head.","1531":"You could have chosen any random number and walked out of here today with everything you\u2019ve worked for ...","1532":"... but you just couldn\u2019t resist it, could you?","1533":"I\u2019ve always assumed that love is a dangerous disadvantage ...","1534":"Thank you for the final proof.","1535":"I know.","1536":"And this is just losing.","1537":"There you are, brother. I hope the contents make up for any inconvenience I may have caused you tonight.","1538":"If you\u2019re feeling kind, lock her up; otherwise let her go. I doubt she\u2019ll survive long without her protection.","1539":"Yes.","1540":"Sorry about dinner.","1541":"Clearly you\u2019ve got news.","1542":"If it\u2019s about the Leeds triple murder, it was the gardener. Nobody noticed the earring.","1543":"Oh? Something happened? Has she come back?","1544":"Is she back in London?","1545":"America?","1546":"I know what?","1547":"Why would I want to see her again?","1548":"Is that her file?","1549":"No.","1550":"Oh, but I will have the camera phone, though.","1551":"I know, but I ...","1552":"... I\u2019ll still have it.","1553":"Please.","1554":"Thank you.","1555":"Yes.","1556":"Once, a few months ago.","1557":"\u201cGoodbye, Mr. Holmes.\u201d","1558":"When I say run, run!","1559":"The Woman.","1560":"The Woman.","1561":"Well, that was tedious.","1562":"None of the cabs would take me.","1563":"Nothing?","1564":"Hmm.","1565":"Nothing of importance?","1566":"Oh, God!","1567":"John, I need some. Get me some.","1568":"Get me some.","1569":"Stupid idea. Whose idea was that?","1570":"Mrs Hudson!","1571":"Tell me where they are. Please. Tell me.","1572":"Please.","1573":"I\u2019ll let you know next week\u2019s lottery numbers.","1574":"Oh, it was worth a try.","1575":"My secret supply: what have you done with my secret supply?","1576":"Cigarettes! What have you done with them? Where are they?","1577":"I thought you weren\u2019t my housekeeper.","1578":"I need something stronger than tea. Seven per cent stronger.","1579":"You\u2019ve been to see Mr. Chatterjee again.","1580":"Sandwich shop. That\u2019s a new dress, but there\u2019s flour on the sleeve. You wouldn\u2019t dress like that for baking.","1581":"Thumbnail: tiny traces of foil. Been at the scratch cards again. We all know where that leads, don\u2019t we?","1582":"Mmm: Kasbah Nights. Pretty racy for first thing on a Monday morning, wouldn\u2019t you agree? I\u2019ve written a little blog on the identification of perfumes. It\u2019s on the website \u2013 you should look it up.","1583":"I wouldn\u2019t pin your hopes on that cruise with Mr. Chatterjee. He\u2019s got a wife in Doncaster  that nobody knows about.","1584":"Well, nobody except me.","1585":"You don\u2019t understand.","1586":"Apologise?","1587":"Oh, John, I envy you so much.","1588":"Your mind: it\u2019s so placid, straightforward, barely used. Mine\u2019s like an engine, racing out of control; a rocket tearing itself to pieces trapped on the launch pad.  I need a case!","1589":"That was this morning!","1590":"When\u2019s the next one?","1591":"\u201cDear Mr. Sherlock Holmes. I can\u2019t find Bluebell anywhere. Please please please can you help?\u201d","1592":"A rabbit, John!","1593":"Ah, but there\u2019s more! Before Bluebell disappeared, it turned luminous ...","1594":"... \u201clike a fairy\u201d according to little Kirsty; then the next morning, Bluebell was gone! Hutch still locked, no sign of a forced entry ...","1595":"Ah! What am I saying? This is brilliant! Phone Lestrade. Tell him there\u2019s an escaped rabbit.","1596":"It\u2019s this, or Cluedo.","1597":"Why not?","1598":"Well, it was the only possible solution.","1599":"Then the rules are wrong!","1600":"Maximum pressure just under the half second.","1601":"What did you see?","1602":"Yes, in a TV interview. I prefer to do my own editing.","1603":"But quite quickly.","1604":"No.","1605":"Mmm, not interested. Moving on.","1606":"Yes, good. Skipping to the night that your dad was violently killed. Where did that happen?","1607":"So?","1608":"Or a genetic experiment.","1609":"Why, are you joking?","1610":"And, I assume, did wonders for Devon tourism.","1611":"Because of what happened last night.","1612":"I didn\u2019t know; I noticed.","1613":"You came up from Devon on the first available train this morning. You had a disappointing breakfast and a cup of black coffee. The girl in the seat across the aisle fancied you. Although you were initially keen, you\u2019ve now changed your mind. You are, however, extremely anxious to have your first cigarette of the day. Sit down, Mr. Knight, and do please smoke. I\u2019d be delighted.","1614":"Punched-out holes where your ticket\u2019s been checked ...","1615":"Oh please. I\u2019ve been cooped up in here for ages.","1616":"Of course. I am a show-off. That\u2019s what we do.","1617":"The train napkin that you used to mop up the spilled coffee: the strength of the stain shows that you didn\u2019t take milk. There are traces of ketchup on it and round your lips and on your sleeve. Cooked breakfast \u2013 or the nearest thing those trains can manage. Probably a sandwich.","1618":"Is there any other type of breakfast on a train? The girl \u2013 female handwriting\u2019s quite distinctive. Wrote her phone number down on the napkin. I can tell from the angle she wrote at that she was sat across from you on the other side of the aisle. Later \u2013 after she got off, I imagine \u2013 you used the napkin to mop up your spilled coffee, accidentally smudging the numbers. You\u2019ve been over the last four digits yourself with another pen, so you wanted to keep the number. Just now, though, you used the napkin to blow your nose. Maybe you\u2019re not that into her after all. Then there\u2019s the nicotine stains on your fingers ... your shaking fingers. I know the signs.","1619":"No chance to smoke one on the train; no time to roll one before you got a cab here.","1620":"It\u2019s just after nine fifteen. You\u2019re desperate. The first train from Exeter to London leaves at five forty-six a.m. You got the first one possible, so something important must have happened last night. Am I wrong?","1621":"It\u2019s my job.","1622":"Now shut up and smoke.","1623":"His therapist.","1624":"Obviously.","1625":"And what happened when you went back to Dewer\u2019s Hollow last night, Henry? You went there on the advice of your therapist and now you\u2019re consulting a detective. What did you see that changed everything?","1626":"Yes, if I wanted poetry, I\u2019d read John\u2019s emails to his girlfriends. Much funnier.","1627":"What did you see?","1628":"Is that it? Nothing else. Footprints. Is that all?","1629":"No, sorry, Doctor Mortimer wins. Childhood trauma masked by an invented memory. Boring! Goodbye, Mr. Knight. Thank you for smoking.","1630":"Oh, they\u2019re probably paw prints; could be anything, therefore nothing.","1631":"Off to Devon with you; have a cream tea on me.","1632":"Say that again.","1633":"No, no, no, your exact words. Repeat your exact words from a moment ago, exactly as you said them.","1634":"I\u2019ll take the case.","1635":"Thank you for bringing this to my attention. It\u2019s very promising.","1636":"It\u2019s nothing to do with footprints. As ever, John, you weren\u2019t listening. Baskerville: ever heard of it?","1637":"Sounds like a good place to start.","1638":"No, I can\u2019t leave London at the moment. Far too busy. Don\u2019t worry \u2013 putting my best man onto it.","1639":"Always rely on John to send me the relevant data, as he never understands a word of it himself.","1640":"Bluebell, John! I\u2019ve got Bluebell! The case of the vanishing, glow-in-the-dark rabbit!  NATO\u2019s in uproar.","1641":"I don\u2019t need those any more. I\u2019m going to Dartmoor.","1642":"You go on ahead, Henry. We\u2019ll follow later.","1643":"Twenty year old disappearance; a monstrous hound? I wouldn\u2019t miss this for the world!","1644":"Mmm. Wait \u2019til she finds out about the one in Islamabad.","1645":"Paddington Station, please.","1646":"What\u2019s that?","1647":"Clearly.","1648":"I\u2019m cold.","1649":"Mind if I join you?","1650":"It\u2019s not true, is it? You haven\u2019t actually seen this ... hound thing. .","1651":"No, nothing like that. Just curious. Have you seen it?","1652":"Got any proof?","1653":"Bet\u2019s off, John, sorry.","1654":"My plan needs darkness.  Reckon we\u2019ve got another half an hour of light ...","1655":"Oh, I bet John here fifty quid that you couldn\u2019t prove you\u2019d seen the hound.","1656":"Yeah?","1657":"I see. No witnesses, I suppose.","1658":"Never are.","1659":"Is that it? It\u2019s not exactly proof, is it?","1660":"Sorry, John. I win.","1661":"Ooh! Is it haunted? Is that supposed to convince me?","1662":"A clone, a super-dog?","1663":"Is that the best you\u2019ve got?","1664":"It\u2019s not specific to this place. It\u2019s my brother\u2019s. Access all areas. I, um ...  ... acquired it ages ago, just in case.","1665":"What\u2019s the matter?","1666":"No we won\u2019t \u2013 well, not just yet.","1667":"Thank you.","1668":"I\u2019ve told you \u2013 he practically is the British government. I reckon we\u2019ve got about twenty minutes before they realise something\u2019s wrong.","1669":"\u201cAre we in trouble, sir.\u201d","1670":"You were expecting us?","1671":"Well, I hope not, Corporal, I hope not.","1672":"Nice touch.","1673":"Enjoy it?","1674":"How many animals do you keep down here?","1675":"Any ever escape?","1676":"Unless they have help.","1677":"Stapleton.","1678":"We\u2019re to be accorded every courtesy, Doctor Stapleton. What\u2019s your role at Baskerville?","1679":"Oh, you most certainly are free ...  ... and I suggest you remain that way.","1680":"Stapleton. I knew I knew your name.","1681":"People say there\u2019s no such thing as coincidence. What dull lives they must lead.","1682":"Why did Bluebell have to die, Doctor Stapleton?","1683":"Disappeared from inside a locked hutch, which was always suggestive.","1684":"Clearly an inside job.","1685":"Why? Because it glowed in the dark.","1686":"Well, I think we\u2019ve seen enough for now, Corporal. Thank you so much.","1687":"That\u2019s it.  It\u2019s this way, isn\u2019t it?","1688":"Twenty-three minutes. Mycroft\u2019s getting slow.","1689":"Deeply; hugely.","1690":"I\u2019m so sorry, Major.","1691":"New policy. Can\u2019t remain unmonitored forever. Goodness knows what you\u2019d get up to.  Keep walking.","1692":"Ah, well ...","1693":"Vienna.","1694":"Thank you.","1695":"That wasn\u2019t my hat.","1696":"It wasn\u2019t my hat.","1697":"You know Henry Knight?","1698":"I never did ask, Doctor Frankland. What exactly is it that you do here?","1699":"That would be tremendously ambitious of you.","1700":"Tell me about Doctor Stapleton.","1701":"Yet you\u2019d speak well of one, which you\u2019re clearly omitting to do.","1702":"I\u2019ll be in touch.","1703":"So?","1704":"Do what?","1705":"... I don\u2019t do that.","1706":"Kirsty Stapleton, whose mother specialises in genetic manipulation.","1707":"Probably a fluorescent gene removed and spliced into the specimen. Simple enough these days.","1708":"So we know that Doctor Stapleton performs secret genetic experiments on animals. The question is: has she been working on something deadlier than a rabbit?","1709":"\u201cLiberty in death\u201d \u2013 isn\u2019t that the expression? The only true freedom.","1710":"Yes.","1711":"We take you back out onto the moor ...","1712":"... and see if anything attacks you.","1713":"That should bring things to a head.","1714":"Mmm.","1715":"Got any better ideas?","1716":"Listen, if there is a monster out there, John, there\u2019s only one thing to do: find out where it lives.","1717":"Met a friend of yours.","1718":"Doctor Frankland.","1719":"Seems pretty concerned about you.","1720":"He knew your father.","1721":"But he works at Baskerville. Didn\u2019t your dad have a problem with that?","1722":"What about us?","1723":"No. I didn\u2019t see anything.","1724":"I didn\u2019t. See. Anything.","1725":"Henry\u2019s right.","1726":"I saw it too.","1727":"I saw it too, John.","1728":"A hound, out there in the Hollow.  A gigantic hound.","1729":"Once you\u2019ve ruled out the impossible, whatever remains \u2013 however improbable \u2013 must be true.","1730":"Look at me. I\u2019m afraid, John. Afraid.","1731":"Always been able to keep myself distant ...  ... divorce myself from ... feelings. But look, you see ...","1732":"... body\u2019s betraying me. Interesting, yes? Emotions.  The grit on the lens, the fly in the ointment.","1733":"Worked ... up?","1734":"Me?! There\u2019s nothing wrong with me.","1735":"THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH ME!","1736":"DO YOU UNDERSTAND?","1737":"You want me to prove it, yes?","1738":"We\u2019re looking for a dog, yes, a great big dog, that\u2019s your brilliant theory. Cherchez le chien. Good, excellent, yes, where shall we start?","1739":"How about them? The sentimental widow and her son, the unemployed fisherman. The answer\u2019s yes.","1740":"She\u2019s got a West Highland terrier called Whisky. Not exactly what we\u2019re looking for.","1741":"Look at the jumper he\u2019s wearing. Hardly worn. Clearly he\u2019s uncomfortable in it. Maybe it\u2019s because of the material; more likely the hideous pattern, suggesting it\u2019s a present, probably Christmas. So he wants into his mother\u2019s good books. Why? Almost certainly money.","1742":"He\u2019s treating her to a meal but his own portion is small. That means he wants to impress her, but he\u2019s trying to economise on his own food.","1743":"No, small plate. Starter. He\u2019s practically licked it clean. She\u2019s nearly finished her pavlova. If she\u2019d treated him, he\u2019d have had as much as he wanted. He\u2019s hungry all right, and not well off \u2013 you can tell that by the state of his cuffs and shoes.","1744":"\u201cHow d\u2019you know she\u2019s his mother?\u201d","1745":"Who else would give him a Christmas present like that? Well, it could be an aunt or an elder sister, but mother\u2019s more likely. Now, he was a fisherman. Scarring pattern on his hands, very distinctive \u2013 fish hooks. They\u2019re all quite old now, which suggests he\u2019s been unemployed for some time. Not much industry in this part of the world, so he\u2019s turned to his widowed mother for help. \u201cWidowed?\u201d Yes, obviously. She\u2019s got a man\u2019s wedding ring on a chain round her neck \u2013 clearly her late husband\u2019s and too big for her finger. She\u2019s well-dressed but her jewellery\u2019s cheap. She could afford better, but she\u2019s kept it \u2013 it\u2019s sentimental. Now, the dog ...  ... tiny little hairs all over the leg from where it gets a little bit too friendly, but no hairs above the knees, suggesting it\u2019s a small dog, probably a terrier. In fact it is \u2013 a West Highland terrier called Whisky. \u201cHow the hell do you know that, Sherlock?\u201d \u2019Cause she was on the same train as us and I heard her calling its name and that\u2019s not cheating, that\u2019s listening, I use my senses, John, unlike some people, so you see, I am fine, in fact I\u2019ve never been better, so just Leave. Me. Alone.","1746":"I don\u2019t have friends.","1747":"Morning!","1748":"Oh, how are you feeling?","1749":"That\u2019s a shame. Shall I make you some coffee?  Oh look, you\u2019ve got damp!","1750":"Hound.","1751":"Why do you call it a hound? Why a hound?","1752":"It\u2019s odd, isn\u2019t it? Strange choice of words \u2013 archaic. It\u2019s why I took the case. \u201cMr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound.\u201d Why say \u201chound\u201d?","1753":"Actually, I\u2019d better skip the coffee.","1754":"Did you, er, get anywhere with that Morse code?","1755":"U, M, Q, R, A, wasn\u2019t it?","1756":"UMQRA.","1757":"U.M.Q...","1758":"Sure?","1759":"How about Louise Mortimer? Did you get anywhere with her?","1760":"Too bad. Did you get any information?","1761":"Thought it might break the ice a bit.","1762":"John ...","1763":"No, wait. What happened last night ... Something happened to me; something I\u2019ve not really experienced before ...","1764":"No-no-no, it was more than that, John. It was doubt. I felt doubt. I\u2019ve always been able to trust my senses, the evidence of my own eyes, until last night.","1765":"No, I can\u2019t believe that.  But I did see it, so the question is: how? How?","1766":"Listen, what I said before, John. I meant it.","1767":"I don\u2019t have friends.","1768":"I\u2019ve just got one.","1769":"John? John!","1770":"You are amazing! You are fantastic!","1771":"You\u2019ve never been the most luminous of people, but as a conductor of light you are unbeatable.","1772":"Some people who aren\u2019t geniuses have an amazing ability to stimulate it in others.","1773":"But what if it\u2019s not a word? What if it is individual letters?","1774":"Absolutely no idea but ...","1775":"What the hell are you doing here?","1776":"No, I wouldn\u2019t.","1777":"I\u2019m waiting for an explanation, Inspector. Why are you here?","1778":"You\u2019re brown as a nut. You\u2019re clearly just back from your \u2018holidays\u2019.","1779":"Oh, this is Mycroft, isn\u2019t it?","1780":"Of course it is! One mention of Baskerville and he sends down my handler to ... to spy on me incognito. Is that why you\u2019re calling yourself Greg?","1781":"Is it?","1782":"Why?","1783":"Excellent.","1784":"Coffee. I made coffee.","1785":"I just did. Don\u2019t you want it?","1786":"\u201cWas\u201d?","1787":"No reason not to.","1788":"Looks like it.","1789":"No.  It was immense, had burning red eyes and it was glowing, John. Its whole body was glowing.","1790":"I\u2019ve got a theory but I need to get back into Baskerville to test it.","1791":"Might not have to.","1792":"Hello, brother dear. How are you?","1793":"I need to see Major Barrymore as soon as we get inside.","1794":"Which means you\u2019ll have to start the search for the hound.","1795":"In the labs; Stapleton\u2019s first.","1796":"Could be dangerous.","1797":"It\u2019s a simple enough request, Major.","1798":"You\u2019re to give me twenty-four hours. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve ...  ... negotiated.","1799":"Perhaps the truth.","1800":"Have you got any of those?","1801":"Oh, just wondering.","1802":"Where are you?","1803":"John? John?","1804":"All right, I\u2019ll find you. Keep talking.","1805":"Keep talking. What are you seeing?","1806":"John?","1807":"What can you see?","1808":"Stay calm, stay calm. Can you see it?","1809":"Can you see it?","1810":"Are you all right?","1811":"John ...","1812":"It\u2019s all right. It\u2019s okay now.","1813":"Well, let\u2019s not jump to conclusions.","1814":"What did you see?","1815":"Huge; red eyes?","1816":"Glowing?","1817":"No.","1818":"I made up the bit about glowing. You saw what you expected to see because I told you. You have been drugged. We have all been drugged.","1819":"Can you walk?","1820":"Come on, then. It\u2019s time to lay this ghost.","1821":"Murder, Doctor Stapleton. Refined, cold-blooded murder.","1822":"Will you tell little Kirsty what happened to Bluebell or shall I?","1823":"Can I borrow your microscope?","1824":"It\u2019s not there!","1825":"Nothing there! Doesn\u2019t make any sense.","1826":"A drug, of course. There has to be a drug \u2013 a hallucinogenic or a deliriant of some kind. There\u2019s no trace of anything in the sugar.","1827":"The sugar, yes. It\u2019s a simple process of elimination. I saw the hound \u2013 saw it as my imagination expected me to see it: a genetically engineered monster. But I knew I couldn\u2019t believe the evidence of my own eyes, so there were seven possible reasons for it, the most possible being narcotics. Henry Knight \u2013 he saw it too but you didn\u2019t, John. You didn\u2019t see it. Now, we have eaten and drunk exactly the same things since we got to Grimpen apart from one thing: you don\u2019t take sugar in your coffee.","1828":"I took it from Henry\u2019s kitchen \u2013 his sugar.  It\u2019s perfectly all right.","1829":"No, it has to be a drug.","1830":"But how did it get into our systems. How?","1831":"There has to be something ...","1832":"... something ... ah, something ...","1833":"... something buried deep.","1834":"Get out.","1835":"Get out. I need to go to my mind palace.","1836":"John.","1837":"Project HOUND. Must have read about it and stored it away. An experiment in a CIA facility in Liberty, Indiana.","1838":"H, O, U, N, D.","1839":"Password, password, password.","1840":"He sat here when he thought it up.","1841":"Describe him to me.","1842":"But describe him.","1843":"Good, excellent. Old-fashioned, traditionalist; not the sort that would use his children\u2019s names as a password.  He loves his job; proud of it and this is work-related, so what\u2019s at eye level?","1844":"Books.  Jane\u2019s Defence Weekly \u2013 bound copies.  Hannibal; Wellington; Rommel; Churchill\u2019s \u201cHistory of the English-Speaking Peoples\u201d \u2013 all four volumes.","1845":"Churchill \u2013 well, he\u2019s fond of Churchill.  Copy of \u201cThe Downing Street Years\u201d; one, two, three, four, five separate biographies of Thatcher.","1846":"Mid nineteen eighties at a guess. Father and son: Barrymore senior.  Medals: Distinguished Service Order.","1847":"Right. So Thatcher\u2019s looking a more likely bet than Churchill.","1848":"No. With a man like Major Barrymore, only first name terms would do.","1849":"Project HOUND: a new deliriant drug which rendered its users incredibly suggestible. They wanted to use it as an anti-personnel weapon to totally disorientate the enemy using fear and stimulus; but they shut it down and hid it away in nineteen eighty-six.","1850":"And what they did to others. Prolonged exposure drove them insane \u2013 made them almost uncontrollably aggressive.","1851":"Attempting to refine it, perhaps, for the last twenty years.","1852":"Five principal scientists, twenty years ago.","1853":"Maybe our friend\u2019s somewhere in the back of the picture \u2013 someone who was old enough to be there at the time of the experiments in 1986 ...","1854":"Maybe somebody who says \u201ccell phone\u201d because of time spent in America. You remember, John?","1855":"He gave us his number in case we needed him.","1856":"It\u2019s where he started, though ... and he\u2019s never lost the certainty, the obsession that that drug really could work. Nice of him to give us his number.  Let\u2019s arrange a little meeting.","1857":"Henry?","1858":"Gone?","1859":"There\u2019s only one place he\u2019ll go to: back to where it all started.  Lestrade. Get to the Hollow. ... Dewer\u2019s Hollow, now. And bring a gun.","1860":"No, Henry, no! No!","1861":"Yes, I\u2019m sure you do, Henry. It\u2019s all been explained to you, hasn\u2019t it \u2013 explained very carefully.","1862":"Someone needed to keep you quiet; needed to keep you as a child to reassert the dream that you\u2019d both clung on to, because you had started to remember.","1863":"Remember now, Henry. You\u2019ve got to remember what happened here when you were a little boy.","1864":"Henry, remember. \u201cLiberty In.\u201d Two words; two words a frightened little boy saw here twenty years ago.","1865":"You\u2019d started to piece things together, remember what really happened here that night. It wasn\u2019t an animal, was it, Henry?","1866":"Not a monster.","1867":"A man.","1868":"You couldn\u2019t cope. You were just a child, so you rationalised it into something very different. But then you started to remember, so you had to be stopped; driven out of your mind so that no-one would believe a word that you said.","1869":"Yeah, but there was a dog, Henry, leaving footprints, scaring witnesses, but it was nothing more than an ordinary dog. We both saw it \u2013 saw it as our drugged minds wanted us to see it. Fear and stimulus; that\u2019s how it works.","1870":"But there never was any monster.","1871":"Henry, Henry ...","1872":"All right! It\u2019s still here ...  ... but it\u2019s just a dog. Henry! It\u2019s nothing more than an ordinary dog!","1873":"No!","1874":"It\u2019s not you! You\u2019re not here!","1875":"The fog.","1876":"It\u2019s the fog! The drug: it\u2019s in the fog! Aerosol dispersal \u2013 that\u2019s what it said in those records. Project HOUND \u2013 it\u2019s the fog! A chemical minefield!","1877":"Look at it, Henry.","1878":"Come on, look at it!","1879":"Because dead men get listened to. He needed to do more than kill you. He had to discredit every word you ever said about your father, and he had the means right at his feet \u2013 a chemical minefield, pressure pads in the ground dosing you up every time that you came back here.","1880":"Murder weapon and scene of the crime all at once.","1881":"Oh, this case, Henry! Thank you. It\u2019s been brilliant.","1882":"What?","1883":"Not good?","1884":"Frankland!","1885":"Frankland!","1886":"It\u2019s no use, Frankland!","1887":"So they didn\u2019t have it put down, then \u2013 the dog.","1888":"I see.","1889":"No, I don\u2019t. Sentiment?","1890":"Oh.","1891":"D\u2019you want some sauce with that?","1892":"You must have been dosed with it elsewhere, when you went to the lab, maybe. You saw those pipes \u2013 pretty ancient, leaky as a sieve; and they were carrying the gas, so ... Um, ketchup, was it, or brown ...?","1893":"Better get going, actually.  There\u2019s a train that leaves in half an hour, so if you want ...","1894":"I had to. It was an experiment.","1895":"Shhh.","1896":"I thought that the drug was in the sugar, so I put the sugar in your coffee, then I arranged everything with Major Barrymore.","1897":"It was all totally scientific, laboratory conditions \u2013 well, literally.","1898":"All right. Keep talking. I\u2019ll find you.","1899":"Keep talking!","1900":"Tell me what you\u2019re seeing!","1901":"Well, I knew what effect it had had on a superior mind, so I needed to try it on an average one.","1902":"You know what I mean.","1903":"No, well, I wasn\u2019t to know you\u2019d already been exposed to the gas.","1904":"No.","1905":"A bit.

Pressure on; facing a deadline.","1950":"And there\u2019s a smudge of ink on your wrist; and a bulge in your left jacket pocket.","1951":"The smudge is deliberate, to see if I\u2019m as good as they say I am.","1952":"Hmm. Oil-based; used in newspaper print, but drawn on with an index finger; your finger.","1953":"Journalist. Unlikely you\u2019d get your hands dirty at the press. You put that there to test me.","1954":"You mean I\u2019d make a great feature: \u201cSherlock Holmes \u2013 the man beneath the hat\u201d.","1955":"No. I\u2019m just saving you the trouble of asking. No, I won\u2019t give you an interview; no, I don\u2019t want the money.","1956":"And you think you\u2019re the girl for that job, do you?","1957":"Smart, okay: investigative journalist. Good. Well, look at me and tell me what you see.","1958":"If you\u2019re that skilful, you don\u2019t need an interview. You can just read what you need.","1959":"No? Okay, my turn.","1960":"I look at you and I see someone who\u2019s still waiting for their first big scoop so that their editor will notice them. You\u2019re wearing an expensive skirt but it\u2019s been re-hemmed twice; only posh skirt you\u2019ve got. And your nails: you can\u2019t afford to do them that often. I see someone who\u2019s hungry. I don\u2019t see smart, and I definitely don\u2019t see trustworthy, but I\u2019ll give you a quote if you like \u2013 three little words.","1961":"You ... repel ... me.","1962":"Yes.","1963":"James Moriarty is for hire.","1964":"Yes.","1965":"No, the sort who\u2019d plant a bomb or stage an assassination, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019d make a pretty decent job of your boiler.","1966":"Leading.","1967":"Can\u2019t do that. You\u2019re leading the witness.  He\u2019ll object and the judge will uphold.","1968":"Ask me how. How would I describe him? What opinion have I formed of him? Do they not teach you this?","1969":"First mistake.  James Moriarty isn\u2019t a man at all \u2013 he\u2019s a spider; a spider at the centre of a web \u2013 a criminal web with a thousand threads and he knows precisely how each and every single one of them dances.","1970":"No, no, don\u2019t-don\u2019t do that. That\u2019s really not a good question.","1971":"How long have I known him? Not really your best line of enquiry. We met twice, five minutes in total. I pulled a gun; he tried to blow me up.  I felt we had a special something.","1972":"Two minutes would have made me an expert. Five was ample.","1973":"Oh, really?","1974":"One librarian; two teachers; two high-pressured jobs, probably the City.","1975":"The foreman\u2019s a medical secretary, trained abroad judging by her shorthand.","1976":"Seven are married and two are having an affair \u2013 with each other, it would seem! Oh, and they\u2019ve just had tea and biscuits.","1977":"Would you like to know who ate the wafer?","1978":"I can\u2019t just turn it on and off like a tap.","1979":"Well?","1980":"You were there for the whole thing, up in the gallery, start to finish.","1981":"Moriarty\u2019s not mounting any defence.","1982":"... he ended up in custody.","1983":"Do what?","1984":"Look?","1985":"Well, I can\u2019t see it, can I?","1986":"It\u2019s my face.","1987":"Well, we do.","1988":"If Moriarty wanted the Jewels, he\u2019d have them. If he wanted those prisoners free, they\u2019d be out on the streets. The only reason he\u2019s still in a prison cell right now is because he chose to be there.","1989":"Somehow this is part of his scheme.","1990":"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. James Moriarty stands accused of several counts of attempted burglary, crimes which \u2013 if he\u2019s found guilty \u2013 will elicit a very long custodial sentence; and yet his legal team has chosen to offer no evidence whatsoever to support their plea. I find myself in the unusual position of recommending a verdict wholeheartedly. You must find him guilty.","1991":"Guilty.","1992":"Most people knock.  But then you\u2019re not most people, I suppose.","1993":"Kettle\u2019s just boiled.","1994":"Please.","1995":"... and the dying man jumped out of his bed, ran straight to the piano and finished it.","1996":"Neither can you. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve come.","1997":"What, with the verdict?","1998":"Got to the jury, of course.","1999":"Cable network.","2000":"So how\u2019re you going to do it ...","2001":"... burn me?","2002":"I dunno.","2003":"Told them what?","2004":"No.","2005":"Obviously.","2006":"You want me to tell you what you already know?","2007":"You didn\u2019t take anything because you don\u2019t need to.","2008":"You\u2019ll never need to take anything ever again.","2009":"Because nothing ... nothing in the Bank of England, the Tower of London or Pentonville Prison could possibly match the value of the key that could get you into all three.","2010":"You were advertising all the way through the trial. You were showing the world what you can do.","2011":"If you could break any bank, what do you care about the highest bidder?","2012":"Why are you doing all of this?","2013":"You don\u2019t want money or power \u2013 not really.","2014":"What is it all for?","2015":"Never liked riddles.","2016":"Kidnapping.","2017":"Miss Mackenzie, you\u2019re in charge of pupil welfare, yet you left this place wide open last night.  What are you: an idiot, a drunk or a criminal?","2018":"Now quickly, tell me!","2019":"I do. I just wanted you to speak quickly.","2020":"Miss Mackenzie will need to breathe into a bag now.","2021":"Show me where the brother slept.","2022":"The boy sleeps there every night, gazing at the only light source outside in the corridor. He\u2019d recognise every shape, every outline, the silhouette of everyone who came to the door.","2023":"So someone approaches the door who he doesn\u2019t recognise, an intruder. Maybe he can even see the outline of a weapon.","2024":"What would he do in the precious few seconds before they came into the room? How would he use them if not to cry out?","2025":"This little boy; this particular little boy ...  ... who reads all of those spy books. What would he do?","2026":"Get Anderson.","2027":"Linseed oil.","2028":"Brilliant, Anderson.","2029":"Yes. Brilliant impression of an idiot.","2030":"The floor.","2031":"The boy was made to walk ahead of them.","2032":"Indicates anxiety; a gun held to his head.","2033":"The girl was pulled beside him, dragged sideways. He had his left arm cradled about her neck.","2034":"You\u2019re right, Anderson \u2013 nothing.","2035":"Except his shoe size, his height, his gait, his walking pace.","2036":"Starting to.","2037":"He walked in when they weren\u2019t locked.","2038":"Anyone can walk in anywhere if they pick the right moment. Yesterday \u2013 end of term, parents milling around, chauffeurs, staff. What\u2019s one more stranger among that lot?","2039":"He was waiting for them. All he had to do was find a place to hide.","2040":"Molly!","2041":"No you\u2019re not.","2042":"Cancel it. You\u2019re having lunch with me.","2043":"Need your help. It\u2019s one of your old boyfriends \u2013 we\u2019re trying to track him down. He\u2019s been a bit naughty!","2044":"Course it\u2019s Moriarty.","2045":"Yes, and then he stole the Crown Jewels, broke into the Bank of England and organised a prison break at Pentonville. For the sake of law and order, I suggest you avoid all future attempts at a relationship, Molly.","2046":"Oil, John.","2047":"The oil in the kidnapper\u2019s footprint \u2013 it\u2019ll lead us to Moriarty.","2048":"All the chemical traces on his shoe have been preserved. The sole of the shoe is like a passport. If we\u2019re lucky we can see everything that he\u2019s been up to.","2049":"I need that analysis.","2050":"Thank you, John.","2051":"Yes.","2052":"I ... owe ... you.","2053":"Glycerol molecule.","2054":"What are you?","2055":"Nothing. Mental note.","2056":"Molly, please don\u2019t feel the need to make conversation. It\u2019s really not your area.","2057":"Molly ...","2058":"You can see me.","2059":"What-what-what could I need from you?","2060":"... Thank you.","2061":"Well, actually, maybe I\u2019ll ...","2062":"Hmm?","2063":"What?","2064":"Breadcrumbs.","2065":"A little trace of breadcrumbs; hardback copy of fairy tales.","2066":"Two children led into the forest by a wicked father follow a little trail of breadcrumbs.","2067":"The sort that likes to boast; the sort that thinks it\u2019s all a game. He sat in our flat and he said these exact words to me ...","2068":"All fairytales need a good old-fashioned villain.","2069":"The fifth substance: it\u2019s part of the tale.","2070":"The witch\u2019s house.","2071":"The glycerol molecule.","2072":"PGPR!","2073":"It\u2019s used in making chocolate.","2074":"Need to find a place in the city where all five of these things intersect.","2075":"I think we\u2019re looking for a disused sweet factory.","2076":"No. No-no-no. Too general. Need something more specific. Chalk; chalky clay \u2013 that\u2019s a far thinner band of geology.","2077":"Building site. Bricks from the nineteen fifties.","2078":"I\u2019ve got people out looking.","2079":"Homeless network \u2013 faster than the police.  Far more relaxed about taking bribes.","2080":"John.","2081":"Rhododendron ponticum. It matches.","2082":"Addlestone.","2083":"There\u2019s a mile of disused factories between the river and the park. It matches everything.","2084":"This was alight moments ago.","2085":"They\u2019re still here.","2086":"Sweet wrappers. What\u2019s he been feeding you?","2087":"Hansel and Gretel.","2088":"Mercury.","2089":"The papers: they\u2019re painted with mercury.","2090":"Lethal. The more of the stuff they ate ...","2091":"But it\u2019s not enough to kill them on its own. Taken in large enough quantities, eventually it would kill them.","2092":"He didn\u2019t need to be there for the execution. Murder by remote control. He could be a thousand miles away.","2093":"The hungrier they got, the more they ate ... the faster they died.","2094":"Neat.","2095":"... not be myself.","2096":"Claudette, I ...","2097":"No-no, I know it\u2019s been hard for you.","2098":"Claudette, listen to me ...","2099":"Thank you.","2100":"Thinking.","2101":"This is my cab. You get the next one.","2102":"You might talk.","2103":"I think we\u2019re looking for a disused sweet factory.","2104":"Can you turn this off, please?","2105":"Can you turn this off ...","2106":"Stop the cab! Stop the cab!","2107":"What was that?","2108":"What was that?","2109":"Thank you.","2110":"He died because I shook his hand.","2111":"He saved my life but he couldn\u2019t touch me. Why?","2112":"Four assassins living right on our doorstep. They didn\u2019t come here to kill me; they have to keep me alive.","2113":"I\u2019ve got something that all of them want, but if one of them approaches me ...","2114":"All of the attention is focussed on me. There\u2019s a surveillance web closing in on us right now.","2115":"We need to ask about the dusting.","2116":"Precise details: in the last week, what\u2019s been cleaned?","2117":"No, in here, this room. This is where we\u2019ll find it \u2013 any break in the dust line. You can put back anything but dust.","2118":"Dust is eloquent.","2119":"Cameras. We\u2019re being watched.","2120":"No, Inspector.","2121":"The answer\u2019s no.","2122":"You want to take me to the station. Just saving you the trouble of asking.","2123":"The scream?","2124":"Who was it? Donovan? I bet it was Donovan. Am I somehow responsible for the kidnapping? Ah, Moriarty is smart. He planted that doubt in her head; that little nagging sensation. You\u2019re gonna have to be strong to resist. You can\u2019t kill an idea, can you? Not once it\u2019s made a home ...  ... there.","2125":"One photograph \u2013 that\u2019s his next move. Moriarty\u2019s game: first the scream, then a photograph of me being taken in for questioning. He wants to destroy me inch by inch.","2126":"It is a game, Lestrade, and not one I\u2019m willing to play.","2127":"Give my regards to Sergeant Donovan.","2128":"They\u2019ll be deciding.","2129":"Whether to come back with a warrant and arrest me.","2130":"Standard procedure.","2131":"I don\u2019t care what people think.","2132":"No, that would just make them stupid or wrong.","2133":"That I am what?","2134":"You\u2019re worried they\u2019re right.","2135":"You\u2019re worried they\u2019re right about me.","2136":"That\u2019s why you\u2019re so upset. You can\u2019t even entertain the possibility that they might be right. You\u2019re afraid that you\u2019ve been taken in as well.","2137":"Moriarty is playing with your mind too.  Can\u2019t you see what\u2019s going on?","2138":"A hundred percent?","2139":"Burnt to a crisp.","2140":"It\u2019s all right, John.","2141":"Joining me?","2142":"Hmm. Bit awkward, this.","2143":"I was thinking more about our imminent and daring escape.","2144":"Ladies and gentlemen, will you all please get on your knees?","2145":"NOW would be good!","2146":"... my hostage.","2147":"Doing what Moriarty wants \u2013 I\u2019m becoming a fugitive. Run.","2148":"Take my hand.","2149":"Leave it!","2150":"Go to your right.","2151":"Go to your right.","2152":"Everybody wants to believe it \u2013 that\u2019s what makes it so clever.  A lie that\u2019s preferable to the truth.  All my brilliant deductions were just a sham. No-one feels inadequate \u2013 Sherlock Holmes is just an ordinary man.","2153":"A big family reconciliation? Now\u2019s not really the moment.","2154":"That\u2019s not the police. It\u2019s one of my new neighbours from Baker Street. Let\u2019s see if he can give us some answers.","2155":"We\u2019re going to jump in front of that bus.","2156":"Tell me what you want from me.","2157":"Tell me.","2158":"Who?","2159":"What?","2160":"Of course. He\u2019s selling it \u2013 the programme he used to break into the Tower. He planted it when he came around.","2161":"It\u2019s a game-changer. It\u2019s a key \u2013 it can break into any system and it\u2019s sitting in our flat right now. That\u2019s why he left that message telling everyone where to come. \u201cGet Sherlock.\u201d We need to get back into the flat and search.","2162":"It\u2019s another subtle way of smearing my name. Now I\u2019m best pals with all those criminals.","2163":"Too late to go on the record?","2164":"Congratulations. The truth about Sherlock Holmes.","2165":"The scoop that everybody wanted and you got it. Bravo.","2166":"And then, behold, someone turns up and spills all the beans. How utterly convenient. Who is Brook?","2167":"Oh, come on, Kitty. No-one trusts the voice at the end of a telephone.","2168":"There are all those furtive little meetings in caf\u00e9s; those sessions in the hotel room where he gabbled into your dictaphone. How do you know that you can trust him? A man turns up with the Holy Grail in his pockets.  What were his credentials?","2169":"Stop it. Stop it NOW!","2170":"No, no, no. He\u2019ll have back-up.","2171":"He\u2019s got my whole life story. That\u2019s what you do when you sell a big lie; you wrap it up in the truth to make it more palatable.","2172":"He\u2019s been sowing doubt into people\u2019s minds for the last twenty-four hours. There\u2019s only one thing he needs to do to complete his game, and that\u2019s to ...","2173":"Something I need to do.","2174":"No \u2013 on my own.","2175":"You\u2019re wrong, you know.","2176":"You do count. You\u2019ve always counted and I\u2019ve always trusted you.","2177":"But you were right. I\u2019m not okay.","2178":"Molly, I think I\u2019m going to die.","2179":"If I wasn\u2019t everything that you think I am \u2013 everything that I think I am \u2013 would you still want to help me?","2180":"You.","2181":"The computer code is key to this. If we find it, we can use it \u2013 beat Moriarty at his own game.","2182":"He used it to create a false identity, so we can use it to break into the records and destroy Richard Brook.","2183":"Somewhere in 221B, somewhere \u2013 on the day of the verdict \u2013 he left it hidden.","2184":"An apple. Nothing else.","2185":"No.","2186":"What is it?","2187":"What? How?","2188":"You go. I\u2019m busy.","2189":"Thinking. I need to think.","2190":"She\u2019s my landlady.","2191":"Alone is what I have. Alone protects me.","2192":"Richard Brook.","2193":"Of course.","2194":"Rich Brook in German is Reichen Bach \u2013 the case that made my name.","2195":"Beats like digits.","2196":"Every beat is a one; every rest is a zero. Binary code. That\u2019s why all those assassins tried to save my life. It was hidden on me; hidden inside my head \u2013 a few simple lines of computer code that can break into any system.","2197":"Yes, but now that it\u2019s up here, I can use it to alter all the records. I can kill Rich Brook and bring back Jim Moriarty.","2198":"But the rhythm ...","2199":"But then how did ...","2200":"Do it? Do \u2013 do what?","2201":"Yes, of course. My suicide.","2202":"I can still prove that you created an entirely false identity.","2203":"You\u2019re insane.","2204":"John.","2205":"Mrs Hudson.","2206":"Lestrade.","2207":"... unless I kill myself \u2013 complete your story.","2208":"And I die in disgrace.","2209":"Would you give me ... one moment, please; one moment of privacy?","2210":"Please?","2211":"\u201cYou\u2019re not going to do it.\u201d So the killers can be called off, then \u2013 there\u2019s a recall code or a word or a number.","2212":"I don\u2019t have to die ...  ... if I\u2019ve got you.","2213":"Yes. So do you.","2214":"Yes, but I\u2019m not my brother, remember? I am you \u2013 prepared to do anything; prepared to burn; prepared to do what ordinary people won\u2019t do. You want me to shake hands with you in hell? I shall not disappoint you.","2215":"Oh, I may be on the side of the angels, but don\u2019t think for one second that I am one of them.","2216":"John.","2217":"Turn around and walk back the way you came now.","2218":"Just do as I ask. Please.","2219":"Stop there.","2220":"Okay, look up. I\u2019m on the rooftop.","2221":"I ... I ... I can\u2019t come down, so we\u2019ll ... we\u2019ll just have to do it like this.","2222":"An apology. It\u2019s all true.","2223":"Everything they said about me. I invented Moriarty.","2224":"I\u2019m a fake.","2225":"The newspapers were right all along. I want you to tell Lestrade; I want you to tell Mrs Hudson, and Molly ... in fact, tell anyone who will listen to you that I created Moriarty for my own purposes.","2226":"Nobody could be that clever.","2227":"I researched you. Before we met I discovered everything that I could to impress you.  It\u2019s a trick. Just a magic trick.","2228":"No, stay exactly where you are. Don\u2019t move.","2229":"Keep your eyes fixed on me.  Please, will you do this for me?","2230":"This phone call \u2013 it\u2019s, er ... it\u2019s my note. It\u2019s what people do, don\u2019t they \u2013 leave a note?","2231":"Goodbye, John.","2232":"It\u2019s a trick. Just a magic trick.","2233":"No, stay exactly where you are.","2234":"Don\u2019t move.","2235":"Keep your eyes fixed on me. Please, will you do this for me?","2236":"This phone call \u2013 it\u2019s ... it\u2019s my note.","2237":"It\u2019s what people do, don\u2019t they? Leave a note?","2238":"Goodbye, John.","2239":"And you invaded Afghanistan!","2240":"Moriarty\u2019s network \u2013 took me two years to dismantle it.","2241":"The Serbian side was the last piece of the puzzle.","2242":"Colossal.","2243":"Hmm.","2244":"What for?","2245":"\u201cWading in\u201d? You sat there and watched me being beaten to a pulp.","2246":"No \u2013 I got me out. Why didn\u2019t you intervene sooner?","2247":"You were enjoying it.","2248":"Definitely enjoying it.","2249":"I didn\u2019t know you spoke Serbian.","2250":"Hmm \u2013 you\u2019re slipping.","2251":"What do you think of this shirt?","2252":"I will find your underground terror cell, Mycroft.","2253":"Just put me back in London. I need to get to know the place again, breathe it in \u2013 feel every quiver of its beating heart.","2254":"And what about John Watson?","2255":"Mmm. Have you seen him?","2256":"No.","2257":"Well, we\u2019ll have to get rid of that.","2258":"He looks ancient. I can\u2019t be seen to be wandering around with an old man.","2259":"I think I\u2019ll surprise John. He\u2019ll be delighted!","2260":"Hmm. I\u2019ll pop into Baker Street. Who knows \u2013 jump out of a cake.","2261":"What life? I\u2019ve been away.","2262":"Where\u2019s he going to be tonight?","2263":"You always know.","2264":"I think maybe I\u2019ll just drop by.","2265":"No it isn\u2019t. Now, where is it?","2266":"You know what.","2267":"Thank you ...","2268":"... blud.","2269":"Your wife just texted you. Possibly her contractions have started.","2270":"Sorry! I\u2019m so, so sorry!","2271":"Please, let me just go to the kitchen and, er, dry that off for you.","2272":"Finished with that, sir? Allow me to take it for you.","2273":"Madam, can I suggest you look at this menu? It\u2019s, er, completely identical.","2274":"Can I \u2019elp you with anything, sir?","2275":"Mmm! Well, these are all excellent vintages.","2276":"Well, you cannot possibly go wrong, but, erm, if you\u2019d like my personal recommendation ...","2277":"... this last one on the list is a favourite of mine.","2278":"It is \u2013 you might, in fact, say \u2013 like a face from ze past.","2279":"It is familiar, but, er, with the quality of surprise!","2280":"Certainly endeavouring to, sir.","2281":"Sir, I think you\u2019ll find this vintage exceptionally to your liking.","2282":"It has all the qualities of the old, with some of the colour of the new.","2283":"Like a gaze from a crowd of strangers ...","2284":"... suddenly one is aware of staring into ze face of an old friend.","2285":"Interesting thing, a tuxedo. Lends distinction to friends, and anonymity to waiters.","2286":"Well, short version ...","2287":"... Not Dead.","2288":"Bit mean, springing it on you like that, I know. Could have given you a heart attack, probably still will. But in my defence, it was very funny.","2289":"Okay, it\u2019s not a great defence.","2290":"Oh yes.","2291":"Not quite.","2292":"No.","2293":"No. I\u2019m quite sure. I checked. Excuse me.","2294":"Does, er, does yours rub off, too? .","2295":"Okay, John, I\u2019m suddenly realising I probably owe you some sort of an apology.","2296":"Wait \u2013 before you do anything that you might regret ...","2297":"... um, one question. Just let me ask one question. Um ...","2298":"Are you really gonna keep that?!","2299":"I calculated that there were thirteen possibilities once I\u2019d invited Moriarty onto the roof.","2300":"I wanted to avoid dying if at all possible.","2301":"The first scenario involved hurling myself into a parked hospital van filled with washing bags. Impossible. The angle was too steep. Secondly, a system of Japanese wrestling ...","2302":"What?","2303":"Why? Because Moriarty had to be stopped.","2304":"Oh. \u2018Why\u2019 as in ...","2305":"I see. Yes. \u2018Why?\u2019 That\u2019s a little more difficult to explain.","2306":"Actually, um, that was mostly Mycroft\u2019s idea.","2307":"Mm-hm.","2308":"Couple of others. .","2309":"It was a very elaborate plan \u2013 it had to be. The next of the thirteen possibilities ...","2310":"Molly.","2311":"Molly Hooper \u2013 and some of my homeless network, and that\u2019s all.","2312":"No! Twenty-five at most.","2313":"Seriously, it\u2019s not a joke?  You\u2019re-you\u2019re really keeping this?","2314":"You\u2019re sure?","2315":"Mmmmmm, no she doesn\u2019t.","2316":"She doesn\u2019t.","2317":"I\u2019ve nearly been in contact so many times, but ...","2318":"... I worried that, you know, you might say something indiscreet.","2319":"Well, you know, let the cat out of the bag.","2320":"Over-reacting.","2321":"Shh!","2322":"Shh!","2323":"Shut up, John! I don\u2019t want everyone knowing I\u2019m still alive!","2324":"Yes! It\u2019s still a secret.","2325":"Promise you won\u2019t tell anyone.","2326":"London is in danger, John. There\u2019s an imminent terrorist attack and I need your help.","2327":"You have missed this. Admit it. The thrill of the chase, the blood pumping through your veins, just the two of us against the rest of the world ...","2328":"I don\u2019t understand.","2329":"I said I\u2019m sorry. Isn\u2019t that what you\u2019re supposed to do?","2330":"Mmm, nature? No. Human? ... No.","2331":"You will?","2332":"Those things\u2019ll kill you.","2333":"It\u2019s time to come back. You\u2019ve been letting things slide, Graham.","2334":"Greg.","2335":"No, stay exactly where you are.","2336":"Don\u2019t move. Keep your eyes fixed on me.","2337":"Please, will you do this for me? Please.","2338":"This phone call \u2013 it\u2019s my note. That\u2019s what people do, don\u2019t they? Leave a note.","2339":"Goodbye, John.","2340":"London. It\u2019s like a great cesspool into which all kinds of criminals, agents and drifters are irresistibly drained.","2341":"Sometimes it\u2019s not a question of \u2018Who?\u2019; it\u2019s a question of \u2018Who Knows?\u2019","2342":"If this man cancels his papers ...","2343":"... I need to know.","2344":"If this woman leaves London without putting her dog into kennels, I need to know.","2345":"There are certain people \u2013 they are markers. If they start to move, I\u2019ll know something\u2019s up \u2013 like rats deserting a sinking ship.","2346":"Boring. Your move.","2347":"\u201cSolid information.\u201d A secret terrorist organisation\u2019s planning an attack \u2013 that\u2019s what secret terrorist organisations do, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s their version of golf.","2348":"Oh, well, perhaps he shouldn\u2019t have done. He was obviously just trying to show off.","2349":"No, Mycroft, but you have to trust me. I\u2019ll find the answer. It\u2019ll be in an odd phrase in an online blog, or an unexpected trip to the countryside, or a misplaced Lonely Hearts ad.","2350":"Your move.","2351":"I am on the case. We\u2019re both on the case. Look at us right now.","2352":"Oopsie!","2353":"Can\u2019t handle a broken heart \u2013 how very telling.","2354":"That takes me back.  \u201cDon\u2019t be smart, Sherlock. I\u2019m the smart one.\u201d","2355":"I used to think I was an idiot.","2356":"Oh, yes. That was a mistake.","2357":"Probably something about trying to make friends.","2358":"And you don\u2019t? Ever?","2359":"Yes, but I\u2019ve been away for two years.","2360":"Oh, I don\u2019t know. I thought perhaps you might have found yourself a ... goldfish.","2361":"Rest assured, Mycroft \u2013 whatever this underground network of yours is up to, the secret will reside in something seemingly insignificant or bizarre.","2362":"Oh, he really can, you know.","2363":"Let\u2019s play something different.","2364":"Well, London\u2019s terror alert has been raised to Critical.  I\u2019m just passing the time. Let\u2019s do deductions.","2365":"Client left this while I was out. What d\u2019you reckon?","2366":"Oh, go on. It\u2019s been an age.","2367":"Which is why you can\u2019t resist.","2368":"Isolated, too, don\u2019t you think?","2369":"\u201cHe\u201d?","2370":"Why? Size of the hat?","2371":"Some women have short hair, too.","2372":"Not that you\u2019ve ever spoken to a woman with short hair \u2013 or, you know, a woman.","2373":"Five times.  Very neatly.  The cost of the repairs exceeds the cost of the hat, so he's mawkishly attached to it, but it\u2019s more than that. One, perhaps two, patches would indicate sentimentality, but five? Five\u2019s excessive behaviour. Obsessive compulsive.","2374":"Peru?","2375":"No.","2376":"Icelandic sheep wool. Similar, but very distinctive if you know what you\u2019re looking for. I\u2019ve written a blog on the varying tensile strengths of different natural fibres.","2377":"You said he was anxious.","2378":"... but also a creature of habit because he hasn\u2019t chewed the bobble on the right.","2379":"Brief sniff of the offending bobble tells us everything we need to know about the state of his breath.","2380":"Brilliant .","2381":"But you\u2019ve missed his isolation.","2382":"Plain as day.","2383":"There for all to see.","2384":"Plain as the nose on your ...","2385":"Well, anybody who wears a hat as stupid as this isn\u2019t in the habit of hanging around other people, is he?","2386":"Exactly.","2387":"He\u2019s different \u2013 so what? Why would he mind? You\u2019re quite right.","2388":"Why would anyone mind?","2389":"How would you know?","2390":"Right. Back to work.","2391":"Mm?","2392":"I tried talking to him. He made his position quite clear.","2393":"F...","2394":"Yes.","2395":"Molly?","2396":"Would you ...","2397":"Would you like to ...","2398":"... solve crimes?","2399":"... monkey glands.","2400":"But enough about Professor Presbury. Tell us more about your case, Mr. Harcourt.","2401":"Absolutely.","2402":"If it makes you feel better.","2403":"You\u2019re not being John \u2013 you\u2019re being yourself.","2404":"Why didn\u2019t you assume it was your wife? .","2405":"No \u2013 it\u2019s because you emptied it.  Weight loss, hair dye, Botox, affair.  Lawyer. Next!","2406":"And your pen pal\u2019s emails just stopped, did they?","2407":"And you really thought he was the one, didn\u2019t you? The love of your life?","2408":"Stepfather posing as online boyfriend.","2409":"Breaks it off, breaks her heart. She swears off relationships, stays at home \u2013 he still has her wage coming in.","2410":"Mr. Windibank, you have been a complete and utter ...","2411":"Mmm. I don\u2019t doubt it.","2412":"Mm, maybe.","2413":"Shut up, John. .","2414":"Hmm? Nothing.","2415":"Just giving it a go.","2416":"Not really in the picture any more.","2417":"Trains.","2418":"Er, no, please. Be my guest.","2419":"Shut up! .","2420":"... six months old.","2421":"Hmm.","2422":"Mm-hm.","2423":"Welcome to my world.","2424":"Get out.","2425":"I won\u2019t insult your intelligence by explaining it to you.","2426":"The-the-the corpse is-is six months old; it\u2019s dressed in a shoddy Victorian outfit from a museum. It\u2019s been displayed on a dummy for many years in a case facing south-east judging from the fading of the fabric. It was sold off in a fire-damage sale ...  ... a week ago.","2427":"Yes.","2428":"Facile.","2429":"Why indeed, John?","2430":"No problem.","2431":"So, what\u2019s this all about, Mr. Shilcott?","2432":"Girlfriend?!","2433":"Sorry. Do go on.","2434":"Yyyes.","2435":"He said he liked trains.","2436":"Bought off?","2437":"So if the driver of the train was in on it, then the passenger did get off.","2438":"I know that face.","2439":"The journey between those stations usually takes five minutes. That journey took ten minutes \u2013 ten minutes to get from Westminster to St James\u2019s Park. So I\u2019m going to need maps \u2013 lots of maps, older maps, all the maps.","2440":"Fancy some chips?","2441":"I know a fantastic fish shop just off the Marylebone Road. The owner always gives me extra portions.","2442":"No \u2013 I helped him put up some shelves.","2443":"Hmm?","2444":"Saying thank you.","2445":"Everything you did for me.","2446":"No, I mean it.","2447":"Moriarty slipped up. He made a mistake. Because the one person he thought didn\u2019t matter at all to me was the one person that mattered the most. You made it all possible.","2448":"But you can\u2019t do this again, can you?","2449":"Oh, congratulations, by the way.","2450":"I hope you\u2019ll be very happy, Molly Hooper. You deserve it. After all, not all the men you fall for can turn out to be sociopaths.","2451":"No.","2452":"Mary? What\u2019s wrong?","2453":"First word, then every third. Save ... John ... Watson.","2454":"Now!","2455":"St James the Less. It\u2019s a church. Twenty minutes by car.","2456":"Did you drive here?","2457":"It\u2019s too slow. It\u2019s too slow.","2458":"This.","2459":"I don\u2019t know.","2460":"Damn!","2461":"Oh my God.","2462":"Jump off!","2463":"Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!","2464":"John!","2465":"John? John!","2466":"Hey, John.","2467":"So did you find it eventually, your lottery ticket?","2468":"John!","2469":"Er, no-no-no, they were just leaving.","2470":"Yes. .","2471":"No, not a case, no-no-no.  Go. Bye.","2472":"Yes, great, wonderful. Just get out.","2473":"Very nice, yes, good. Get out.","2474":"Mm-hmm.","2475":"Promise.","2476":"Oh, for God...","2477":"Sorry about that.","2478":"... Just my parents.","2479":"In town for a few days.","2480":"Mycroft promised to take them to a matinee of \u201cLes Mis\u201d. Tried to talk me into doing it.","2481":"Yes.","2482":"What?","2483":"It\u2019s a cross I have to bear.","2484":"Hmm?","2485":"Maybe.","2486":"Sorry. Sorry again.","2487":"Sorry.","2488":"See you\u2019ve shaved it off, then.","2489":"Mm, I\u2019m glad.","2490":"No \u2013 I prefer my doctors clean-shaven.","2491":"How are you feeling?","2492":"Right.","2493":"I don\u2019t know.","2494":"I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t see the pattern. It\u2019s too nebulous.","2495":"Why would an agent give his life to tell us something incredibly insignificant? That\u2019s what\u2019s strange.","2496":"According to Mycroft. There\u2019s an underground network planning an attack on London \u2013 that\u2019s all we know.","2497":"These are my rats, John.","2498":"My markers: agents, low-lifes, people who might find themselves arrested or their diplomatic immunity suddenly rescinded. If one of them starts acting suspiciously, we know something\u2019s up. Five of them are behaving perfectly normally, but the sixth ...","2499":"Lord Moran, peer of the realm, Minister for Overseas Development. Pillar of the establishment.","2500":"He\u2019s been working for North Korea since 1996.","2501":"He\u2019s the Big Rat. Rat Number One. And he\u2019s just done something very suspicious indeed.","2502":"Not according to the maps.","2503":"There\u2019s something \u2013 something, something I\u2019m missing, something staring me in the face.","2504":"Our rat\u2019s just come out of his den.","2505":"Yes, yes, yes, yes, YES! I\u2019ve been an idiot \u2013 a blind idiot!","2506":"Oh, that\u2019s good. That could be brilliant.","2507":"Mycroft\u2019s intelligence \u2013 it\u2019s not nebulous at all. It\u2019s specific \u2013 incredibly specific.","2508":"Not an underground network, John. It\u2019s an Underground network.","2509":"Sometimes a deception is so audacious, so outrageous that you can\u2019t see it even when it\u2019s staring you in the face.","2510":"Look \u2013 seven carriages leave Westminster ...  ... but only six carriages arrive at St James\u2019s Park.","2511":"Moran didn\u2019t disappear \u2013 the entire Tube compartment did. The driver must have diverted the train and then detached the last carriage.","2512":"Not on the maps, but once you eliminate all the other factors, the only thing remaining must be the truth.  That carriage vanished, so it must be somewhere.","2513":"It vanishes between St James\u2019s Park and Westminster. Lord Moran vanishes. You\u2019re kidnapped and nearly burned to death at a fireworks par...","2514":"What\u2019s the date, John \u2013 today\u2019s date?","2515":"Lord Moran \u2013 he\u2019s a peer of the realm. Normally he\u2019d sit in the House. Tonight there\u2019s an all-night sitting to vote on the new anti-terrorism Bill.","2516":"But he won\u2019t be there. Not tonight.  Not the fifth of November.","2517":"\u201cGunpowder, treason and plot.\u201d","2518":"There has to be. Check again.","2519":"No, it\u2019s none of those. We\u2019ve accounted for those.","2520":"St Margaret\u2019s Street, Bridge Street, Sumatra Road, Parliament Street ...","2521":"It\u2019s right underneath the Palace of Westminster.","2522":"Must be.","2523":"What are you doing?","2524":"What? No!","2525":"They\u2019ll get in the way. They always do. This is cleaner, more efficient.","2526":"A bit.","2527":"What are you doing?","2528":"I don\u2019t understand.","2529":"There\u2019s nowhere else it could be.","2530":"Oh!","2531":"What?","2532":"Perfectly safe as long as we avoid touching the rails. .","2533":"This way.","2534":"Sure.","2535":"John.","2536":"Isn\u2019t there?","2537":"This is the bomb.","2538":"It\u2019s not carrying explosives. The whole compartment is the bomb.","2539":"There may not be time for that now.","2540":"I have no idea.","2541":"Why d\u2019you think I know what to do?","2542":"Doesn\u2019t mean I know how to defuse a giant bomb. What about you?","2543":"And a soldier, as you keep reminding us all.","2544":"That would set it off.","2545":"Er ...","2546":"Er ...","2547":"Please just ...","2548":"Well, it\u2019s no use now.","2549":"Go, John.  Go now.","2550":"Hmm?","2551":"How will that help?","2552":"Oh, and you think I\u2019ve just got \u201cHow To Defuse A Bomb\u201d tucked away in there somewhere?","2553":"Maybe.","2554":"Um, er ...","2555":"Turn that off. Oh God! Er, um, er ...","2556":"I\u2019m sorry.","2557":"I can\u2019t ... I can\u2019t do it, John. I don\u2019t know how.","2558":"Forgive me?","2559":"Please, John, forgive me ... for all the hurt that I caused you.","2560":"No.","2561":"No.","2562":"Not this time.","2563":"Yeah, well, be careful what you wish for.","2564":"If I hadn\u2019t come back, you wouldn\u2019t be standing there and ...","2565":"... you\u2019d still have a future ... with Mary.","2566":"I know.","2567":"The criminal network Moriarty headed was vast.","2568":"Its roots were everywhere like a cancer, so we came up with a plan.","2569":"Mycroft fed Moriarty information about me.","2570":"Moriarty in turn gave us hints \u2013 just hints \u2013 as to the extent of his web. We let him go ...","2571":"... because it was important to let him believe he had the upper hand.  And then I sat back and watched Moriarty destroy my reputation bit by bit.","2572":"I had to make him believe he\u2019d beaten me, utterly defeated me, and then he\u2019d show his hand.","2573":"There were thirteen likely scenarios once we were up on that roof. Each of them were rigorously worked out and given a code name. It wasn\u2019t just my reputation that Moriarty needed to bury \u2013 I had to die.","2574":"... unless I kill myself \u2013 complete your story.","2575":"But the one thing I didn\u2019t anticipate was just how far Moriarty was prepared to go. I suppose that was obvious, given our first meeting at the swimming pool \u2013 his death wish.","2576":"I knew I didn\u2019t have long. I contacted my brother; set the wheels in motion.","2577":"And then everyone got to work.","2578":"It\u2019s a trick. Just a magic trick.","2579":"No, stay exactly where you are. Don\u2019t move.","2580":"Keep your eyes fixed on me.  Please, will you do this for me?","2581":"It was vital that John stayed just where I put him. That way, his view was blocked by the ambulance station.","2582":"I needed to hit the airbag \u2013 which I did.","2583":"Speed was paramount.","2584":"The airbag needed to be got out of the way just as John cleared the station.","2585":"But we needed him to see a body.","2586":"That\u2019s where Molly came in.","2587":"Like figures on a weather clock, we went one way, John went the other.","2588":"Then our well-timed cyclist ...","2589":"... put John briefly out of action ...","2590":"... giving me time to switch places with the corpse on the pavement.","2591":"The rest was just window dressing.","2592":"And one final touch ...","2593":"... a squash ball under the armpit.","2594":"Apply enough pressure and it momentarily cuts off the pulse.","2595":"Everything was anticipated; every eventuality allowed for. It worked ...  ... perfectly.","2596":"Yes. You remember the little girl who was abducted by Moriarty?","2597":"You assumed she reacted like that because I was her kidnapper. But I deduced Moriarty must have found someone who looked very like me to plant suspicion, and that that man \u2013 whoever he was \u2013 had to be got out of the way as soon as his usefulness ended. That meant there was a corpse in a morgue somewhere that looked just like me.","2598":"Molly found the body, faked the records, and I provided the other coat. I\u2019ve got lots of coats.","2599":"Mycroft\u2019s men intervened before he could take the shot. He was invited to reconsider.","2600":"As I explained, the whole street was closed off ...  ... like a scene from a play.","2601":"Neat, don\u2019t you think?","2602":"What?","2603":"Oh really?","2604":"What?","2605":"Everyone\u2019s a critic. Anyway, that\u2019s not why I came.","2606":"No. I think you know why I\u2019m here, Phillip. \u201cHow I Did It\u201d by Jack the Ripper.","2607":"Lurid. A case so sensational, you hoped I\u2019d be interested. But you overdid it, Phillip \u2013 you and your little \u2018fan club\u2019.","2608":"But you didn\u2019t. You were always right. I wasn\u2019t dead.","2609":"Yeah.","2610":"Of course you\u2019ve wasted police time, perverted the course of justice, risked distracting me from a massive terrorist assault that could have both destroyed Parliament and caused the death of hundreds of people.","2611":"Oh, your face!","2612":"Your face!","2613":"I totally had you.","2614":"Oh, those things you said \u2013 such sweet things! I-I never knew you cared.","2615":"Scout\u2019s honour.","2616":"Ahh. .","2617":"There\u2019s an Off switch.","2618":"There\u2019s always an Off switch.","2619":"Terrorists can get into all sorts of problems unless there\u2019s an Off switch.","2620":"I didn\u2019t lie altogether. I\u2019ve absolutely no idea how to turn any of these silly little lights off.","2621":"Oh!","2622":"Course I called the police.","2623":"Oh, please Killing me \u2013 that\u2019s so two years ago.","2624":"Oh, I\u2019m sorry, brother dear, but you made a promise. There\u2019s nothing I can do to help.","2625":"In a minute.","2626":"Weddings \u2013 not really my thing.","2627":"Ready?","2628":"I\u2019m not saying a word.","2629":"Hmm?","2630":"I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t like not knowing.","2631":"Unlike the nicely embellished fictions on your blog, John, real life is rarely so neat.","2632":"I don\u2019t know who was behind all this, but I will find out, I promise you.","2633":"Hmm?","2634":"Oh, don\u2019t be stupid.","2635":"Love what?","2636":"I don\u2019t even know what that\u2019s supposed to mean.","2637":"You know my methods, John. I am known to be indestructible.","2638":"I should hope so.","2639":"I know. I was there.","2640":"I heard you.","2641":"Anyway, time to go and be Sherlock Holmes.","2642":"This is hard.","2643":"Really hard. Hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do.","2644":"Have you any funny stories about John?","2645":"I need anecdotes.","2646":"Didn\u2019t go to any trouble, did you?","2647":"Shut up, Mrs Hudson.","2648":"You\u2019re formulating a question. It\u2019s physically painful watching you thinking.","2649":"It was me playing.","2650":"I am composing.","2651":"I was road-testing.","2652":"Why are you here?","2653":"You bring me tea in the morning?","2654":"I don\u2019t know. I just thought it sort of happened.","2655":"Mm, I know. I have a list. Mycroft has a file.","2656":"What big day?","2657":"Two people who currently live together are about to attend church, have a party, go on a short holiday and then carry on living together. What\u2019s big about that?","2658":"Mmm, no it doesn\u2019t.","2659":"Your husband was executed for double murder. You\u2019re hardly an advert for companionship. .","2660":"As does lethal injection. .","2661":"Aren\u2019t there usually biscuits?","2662":"Have the shops?","2663":"I\u2019m sure the shop on the corner is open.","2664":"Mmm. Anyway, you\u2019ve got things to do.","2665":"Biscuits.","2666":"You can if you like. She understands very little.","2667":"Right, then.","2668":"Into battle.","2669":"Oh, sorry.","2670":"Um, sorry?","2671":"Is it?","2672":"If that\u2019s the sort of thing you\u2019re looking for ...  ... the man over there in blue is your best bet. Recently divorced doctor with a ginger cat ...  ... a barn conversion ...  ... and a history of erectile dysfunction.","2673":"Reviewing that information, possibly not your best bet.","2674":"Sorry \u2013 there was one more deduction there than I was expecting.","2675":"Let\u2019s talk about Mary, first.","2676":"Oh, I think you know what. You went out with her for two years.","2677":"Is that a fact?","2678":"Whenever she tweets, you respond within five minutes regardless of time or current location, suggesting you have her on text alert. In all your Facebook photographs of the happy couple, Mary takes centre frame whereas John is always partly or entirely excluded.","2679":"You volunteered to be a shoulder to cry on on no less than three separate occasions. Do you have anything to say in your defence?","2680":"I think from now on we\u2019ll downgrade you to \u2018casual acquaintance\u2019. No more than three planned social encounters a year, and always in John\u2019s presence.","2681":"I have your contact details. I will be monitoring.","2682":"High-functioning sociopath ... with your number.","2683":"Mm, yes, um, well done in the service, Archie.","2684":"Um ...","2685":"Basically it\u2019s a cute smile to the bride\u2019s side, cute smile to the groom\u2019s side and then the rings.","2686":"And you have to wear the outfit.","2687":"You really do have to wear the outfit.","2688":"Grown-ups like that sort of thing.","2689":"... I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll ask one.","2690":"Yep. .","2691":"Sure. Loads.","2692":"Yeah, all right. .","2693":"Maggots.","2694":"Mm!","2695":"Er, yes ...  ... if he\u2019s good.","2696":"Lovely little village.","2697":"Traces of two leading brands of deodorant, both advertised for their strength, suggestive of a chronic body odour problem manifesting under stress.","2698":"Long-term relationship, compulsive cheat.","2699":"Waterproof cover on his smartphone.  Yet his complexion doesn\u2019t indicate outdoor work.  Suggests he\u2019s in the habit of taking his phone into the shower with him, which means he often receives texts and emails he\u2019d rather went unseen.","2700":"D\u2019you like solving crimes?","2701":"So that\u2019s him. Major Sholto.","2702":"If they\u2019re such good friends, why does he barely even mention him?","2703":"About him?","2704":"Yes, but it\u2019s definitely him that he talks about?","2705":"I\u2019ve never even heard him say his name.","2706":"Yes.","2707":"He is? He\u2019s the most unsociable?","2708":"Ah, that\u2019s why he\u2019s bouncing round him like a puppy.","2709":"Stop smiling.","2710":"Why are you out of breath?","2711":"Either I\u2019ve caught you in a compromising position or you\u2019ve been working out again. I favour the latter.","2712":"I need your answer, Mycroft, as a matter of urgency.","2713":"Even at the eleventh hour it\u2019s not too late, you know.","2714":"Cars can be ordered, private jets commandeered.","2715":"What a shame. Mary and John will be extremely d...","2716":"Oh, I don\u2019t know. There should always be a spectre at the feast.","2717":"What do you mean?","2718":"No, I don\u2019t understand.","2719":"No, no, no \u2013 I prefer to think of it as the beginning of a new chapter.","2720":"What?","2721":"I know that silence. What?","2722":"What?","2723":"Mycroft!","2724":"Involved? I\u2019m not involved.","2725":"John asked me to be his best man. How could I say no?","2726":"I\u2019m not involved!","2727":"I will.","2728":"I\u2019m not a child any more, Mycroft.","2729":"Ladies and gentlemen, family and friends ... and ... erm ... others.","2730":"Er ... w...","2731":"A-a-also ...","2732":"Right, um ...","2733":"First things first. Telegrams.","2734":"Well, they\u2019re not actually telegrams. We just call them telegrams. I don\u2019t know why. Wedding tradition.","2735":"... because we don\u2019t have enough of that already, apparently.","2736":"\u201cTo Mr. and Mrs Watson. So sorry I\u2019m unable to be with you on your special day. Good luck and best wishes, Mike Stamford.\u201d","2737":"\u201cTo John and Mary. All good wishes for your special day. With love and many big ...  ... big squishy cuddles, from Stella and Ted.\u201d","2738":"\u201cMary \u2013 lots of love, ...\u201d","2739":"\u201c... poppet ...\u201d","2740":"\u201c... Oodles of love and heaps of good wishes from CAM.\u201d","2741":"\u201cWish your family could have seen this.\u201d","2742":"Um, \u201cspecial day\u201d ...  ... \u201cvery special day\u201d ...  ... \u201clove\u201d ... \u201clove\u201d ... \u201clove\u201d ... \u201clove\u201d ... \u201clo...\u201d bit of a theme \u2013 you get the gist. People are basically fond.","2743":"John Watson.  My friend, John Watson.  John.","2744":"When John first broached the subject of being best man, I was confused.","2745":"What was that noise downstairs?","2746":"Sounded like she was torturing an owl.","2747":"Could have been both.","2748":"Just occupying myself. Sometimes, it\u2019s so-o-o hard not smoking.","2749":"Er, be my guest.","2750":"Tea? .","2751":"Mm-hm.","2752":"The best man?","2753":"Billy Kincaid.","2754":"Billy Kincaid, the Camden Garrotter. Best man I ever knew. Vast contributions to charity, never disclosed.","2755":"Personally managed to save three hospitals from closure and ran the best and safest children\u2019s homes in north England.","2756":"Yes, every now and again there\u2019d be some garrottings, but stacking up the lives saved against the garrottings, on balance I\u2019d say ...","2757":"Oh, right.","2758":"Gavin?","2759":"Gavin Lestrade? He\u2019s a man, and good at it.","2760":"Oh, Mike Stamford, I see. Well, he\u2019s nice, um, though I\u2019m not sure how well he\u2019d cope with all ...","2761":"Yes.","2762":"Yes.","2763":"I confess at first I didn\u2019t realise he was asking me. When finally I understood, I expressed to him that I was both flattered and ... surprised.","2764":"I explained to him that I\u2019d never expected this request and I was a little daunted in the face of it.","2765":"I nonetheless promised that I would do my very best to accomplish a task which was \u2013 for me \u2013 as demanding and difficult as any I had ever contemplated. Additionally, I thanked him for the trust he\u2019d placed in me ...","2766":"... and indicated that I was, in some ways, very close to being ... moved by it.","2767":"It later transpired that I had said none of this out loud.","2768":"So, in fact ... .","2769":"You-you mean ...","2770":"I\u2019m your ...","2771":"... best ...","2772":"... friend?","2773":"Surprisingly okay.","2774":"Done that. ... Done that ... Done that bit ... Done that bit ... Done that bit ... Hmm ...","2775":"I\u2019m afraid, John, I can\u2019t congratulate you.","2776":"All emotions, and in particular love, stand opposed to the pure, cold reason I hold above all things. A wedding is, in my considered opinion, nothing short of a celebration of all that is false and specious and irrational and sentimental in this ailing and morally compromised world.","2777":"Today we honour the death-watch beetle that is the doom of our society and, in time \u2013 one feels certain \u2013 our entire species.","2778":"But anyway ...  ... let\u2019s talk about John.","2779":"If I burden myself with a little help-mate during my adventures, it is not out of sentiment or caprice \u2013 it is that he has many fine qualities of his own that he has overlooked in his obsession with me.","2780":"Indeed, any reputation I have for mental acuity and sharpness comes, in truth, from the extraordinary contrast John so selflessly provides.","2781":"It is a fact, I believe, that brides tend to favour exceptionally plain bridesmaids for their big day. There is a certain analogy there, I feel.","2782":"... and contrast is, after all, God\u2019s own plan to enhance the beauty of his creation ...","2783":"... or it would be if God were not a ludicrous fantasy designed to provide a career opportunity for the family idiot.","2784":"The point I\u2019m trying to make is that I am the most unpleasant, rude, ignorant and all-round obnoxious arsehole that anyone could possibly have the misfortune to meet. .","2785":"I am dismissive of the virtuous ...","2786":"... unaware of the beautiful ...","2787":"... and uncomprehending in the face of the happy. So if I didn\u2019t understand I was being asked to be best man, it is because I never expected to be anybody\u2019s best friend.","2788":"Certainly not the best friend of the bravest and kindest and wisest human being I have ever had the good fortune of knowing.","2789":"John, I am a ridiculous man ...","2790":"... redeemed only by the warmth and constancy of your friendship. But, as I\u2019m apparently your best friend, I cannot congratulate you on your choice of companion.","2791":"Actually, now I can.","2792":"Mary, when I say you deserve this man, it is the highest compliment of which I am capable. John, you have endured war, and injury, and tragic loss ...  ... so sorry again about that last one ...  ... so know this: today you sit between the woman you have made your wife and the man you have saved \u2013 in short, the two people who love you most in all this world. And I know I speak for Mary as well when I say we will never let you down, and we have a lifetime ahead to prove that.","2793":"Ah, yes. Now on to some funny stories about John ...","2794":"What\u2019s wrong? What happened? Why are you all doing that? John?","2795":"Did I do it wrong?","2796":"I haven\u2019t finished yet.","2797":"So, on to some funny stories ...","2798":"So, on to some funny stories about John.","2799":"If you could all just cheer up a bit, that would ...","2800":"... be better. On we go. So, for funny stories ...  ... one has to look no further than John\u2019s blog.","2801":"The record of our time together. Of course, he does tend to romanticise things a bit, but then, you know ...  ... he\u2019s a romantic. We\u2019ve tackled some strange cases: the Hollow Client ...","2802":"... the Poison Giant ...","2803":"Get down, John! .","2804":"We\u2019ve had some frustrating cases ...","2805":"A French decathlete found completely out of his mind, surrounded by one thousand, eight hundred and twelve matchboxes \u2013 all empty except this one.","2806":"The inexplicable.","2807":"... \u2018touching\u2019 cases ...","2808":"She\u2019s a client. She\u2019s boring. I\u2019ve seen those symptoms before.","2809":"Oscillation on the pavement always means there\u2019s a love affair.","2810":"... and of course I have to mention the elephant in the room.","2811":"But we want something ... very particular for this special day, don\u2019t we?","2812":"The Bloody Guardsman.","2813":"Need to work on your half of the church, Mary. Looking a bit thin.","2814":"Schedule the organ music to begin at precisely 11.48.","2815":"Calm? I am calm. I\u2019m extremely calm.","2816":"Hmm. Hates you. Can\u2019t even bear to think about you.","2817":"Second class post, cheap card ...  ... bought at a petrol station. Look at the stamp: three attempts at licking. She\u2019s obviously unconsciously retaining saliva.","2818":"Oh yes.","2819":"Done.","2820":"Major James Sholto. Who he?","2821":"Identical triplets \u2013 one in half a million births. Solved it without leaving the flat. Now, serviettes.","2822":"Swan, or Sydney Opera House?","2823":"Many unexpected skills required in the field of criminal investigation ...","2824":"I once broke an alibi by demonstrating the exact severity of ...","2825":"Okay \u2013 I learned it on Youtube.","2826":"That just sort of ... happened.","2827":"Lilac.","2828":"Pick what?","2829":"You want to go out on a case? N-now?","2830":"Don\u2019t you worry about a thing. I\u2019ll get you out of this.","2831":"Oh.","2832":"Uniform fetishist. \u201cAll the nice girls like a soldier.\u201d","2833":"\u201cElite Guard.\u201d","2834":"Why this particular Grenadier? Curious.","2835":"Okay.","2836":"... ties.","2837":"... tie.","2838":"Just going to take him out for a bit \u2013 run him.","2839":"Mm.","2840":"Coming.","2841":"Taxi!","2842":"And when will that be?","2843":"Do you think they give them classes?","2844":"How to resist the temptation to scratch their behinds?","2845":"Oh!","2846":"So why don\u2019t you see him any more?","2847":"Your previous commander, Sholto.","2848":"I meant \u201cex\u201d.","2849":"Which you don\u2019t.","2850":"\u2019Course you don\u2019t. He was decorated, wasn\u2019t he? A war hero.","2851":"\u201cCrows\u201d?","2852":"Oh, I wouldn\u2019t count on that.","2853":"I\u2019m ... chatting.","2854":"Won\u2019t be trying that again.","2855":"Oh, good.","2856":"Wasn\u2019t worried.","2857":"Kill him with what? Where\u2019s the weapon?","2858":"Where\u2019s the weapon? Go on, search me.  No weapon.","2859":"No.","2860":"He\u2019s soaking wet and there\u2019s still shampoo in his hair. He got into the shower and then someone stabbed him.","2861":"Well then I\u2019d be soaking wet too, wouldn\u2019t I?","2862":"No. The weapon again \u2013 no knife.","2863":"Man stabbed to death. No murder weapon. Door locked from the inside. Only one way in or out of here.","2864":"Mmm?","2865":"What do we do?","2866":"What?","2867":"\u201cNurse\u201d?","2868":"Private Bainbridge had just come off guard duty. He\u2019d stood there for hours, plenty of people watching, nothing apparently wrong. He came off duty and within minutes was nearly dead from a wound in his stomach, but there was no weapon. Where did it go? Ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to consider this: a murderer who can walk through walls, a weapon that can vanish \u2013 but in all of this there is only one element which can be said to be truly remarkable. Would anyone like to make a guess?","2869":"Come on, come on, there is actually an element of Q and A to all of this.","2870":"Scotland Yard.","2871":"Have you got a theory?","2872":"Yeah, you. You\u2019re a detective \u2013 broadly speaking. Got a theory?","2873":"Brilliant.","2874":"No.","2875":"Next!","2876":"Hello? Who was that?","2877":"Tom.","2878":"Got a theory?","2879":"A meat dagger.","2880":"No.","2881":"There was one feature, and only one feature, of interest in the whole of this baffling case, and quite frankly it was the usual. John Watson \u2013 who, while I was trying to solve the murder, instead saved a life.","2882":"There are mysteries worth solving and stories worth telling.","2883":"The best and bravest man I know \u2013 and on top of that he actually knows how to do stuff.","2884":"... except wedding planning and serviettes \u2013 he\u2019s rubbish at those.","2885":"The case itself remains the most ingenious and brilliantly-planned murder \u2013 or attempted murder \u2013 I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure to encounter; the most perfect locked-room mystery of which I am aware. However, I\u2019m not just here to praise John \u2013 I\u2019m also here to embarrass him, so let\u2019s move on to some ...","2886":"How was what done?","2887":"I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t solve that one. That\u2019s ...  ... It can happen sometimes. It\u2019s very ... very disappointing.","2888":"Embarrassment leads me on to the stag night. Of course there\u2019s hours of material here, but I\u2019ve cut it down to the really good bits.","2889":"Mmmm, pub crawl \u2013 themed.","2890":"Lacks the personal touch. We\u2019re going to go for a drink in every street where we ...","2891":"Don\u2019t want to get ill. That would ruin it \u2013 spoil the mood.","2892":"I lack the practical experience. .","2893":"Occasionally.","2894":"No. No!","2895":"You look ... well.","2896":"How\u2019s ... .","2897":"... Tom?","2898":"Still? Good.","2899":"Okay.","2900":"I want you to calculate John\u2019s ideal intake, and mine, to remain in the sweet spot the whole evening.","2901":"Light-headed, good ...","2902":"Hmm.","2903":"Two, er ... beers, please.","2904":"Four hundred and forty-three point seven millilitres.","2905":"You\u2019ll thank me.","2906":"Cheers.","2907":"Over there.","2908":"Toilets. Any second now, you\u2019re going to ...","2909":"Mmm, on schedule.","2910":"Nothing \u2013 go!","2911":"How long?","2912":"Your visit.","2913":"Estimate approximate volume discharged ...","2914":"I know ash!","2915":"Don\u2019t. Tell. Me. I. Don\u2019t!","2916":"Ash. I know ash.","2917":"I have an international reputation.","2918":"Do you have an international reputation?","2919":"No.","2920":"And I can\u2019t even remember what for.","2921":"Sss... Crime ... something or other.","2922":"Ah, Hudders. What time is it?","2923":"You, or the thing?","2924":"Thank you.","2925":"No, you\u2019re not a vegetable.","2926":"Errr ... am I human?","2927":"Can\u2019t have \u201csometimes\u201d. Has to be, um ...","2928":"Yes, I know, okay.  And am I a man?","2929":"Tall?","2930":"Hmm. Nice?","2931":"Clever?","2932":"You would?","2933":"Mmm, am I important?","2934":"Do \u201cpeople\u201d ...  ... like me?","2935":"Okay.","2936":"Am I the current king of England?","2937":"Don\u2019t we?","2938":"Your go.","2939":"Yes.","2940":"Beauty is a construct based entirely on childhood impressions, influences and role models.","2941":"I don\u2019t know who you are. I don\u2019t know who you\u2019re supposed to be.","2942":"Ah, but I picked it at random from the papers.","2943":"So I am human, I\u2019m not as tall as people think I am ...","2944":"I\u2019m-I\u2019m nice-ish ...","2945":"... clever, important to some people, but I tend to rub them up the wrong way.","2946":"Got it.","2947":"I\u2019m you, aren\u2019t I?","2948":"Hallo!","2949":"Boring, boring, boring \u2013 no!","2950":"Fascinating!","2951":"John \u2013 John! Wake up!","2952":"Apologies about my ...  ... you know ... thing.","2953":"Rude. Rude!","2954":"Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll find him in ten minutes.","2955":"What\u2019s your dog\u2019s name?","2956":"John! Wake up!","2957":"We\u2019re meant to ...  ... The game\u2019s ...  ... something.","2958":"Yeah, that, that!","2959":"Hmm?","2960":"Oh, errrrrr ...","2961":"I\u2019m just gonna whip this out. .","2962":"Mm-hmm?","2963":"Whoa, whoa, whoa!","2964":"What d\u2019you think you\u2019re doing? Don\u2019t compromise the integrity of the ...","2965":"Yeah, that.","2966":"It was awful.","2967":"That woman, Tessa.","2968":"Dated a ghost. The most interesting case for months. What a wasted opportunity.","2969":"There are going to be others.","2970":"Victims, women. Most ghosts tend to haunt a single house \u2013 this ghost, however, is willing to commute, look.","2971":"Mmmmmm, not you.","2972":"Not you.","2973":"Not you.","2974":"Not you. Not you.","2975":"Hi.","2976":"How did you meet?","2977":"Name?","2978":"His name.","2979":"Your place?","2980":"Address?","2981":"Four women in four nights. He must have something special.","2982":"Not now, John.","2983":"Sorry about that.","2984":"Different names, different addresses.","2985":"Describe him.","2986":"He\u2019s stealing the identity of corpses ...","2987":"... getting the names from the Obituary columns.","2988":"All single men. He\u2019s using the dead man\u2019s flat under the assumption it\u2019ll be empty for a while.","2989":"Free love nest.","2990":"Hello, Tessa.","2991":"Meanwhile, back to business. No-one wants to use a dead man\u2019s home.","2992":"... Least not until it\u2019s been cleared. So, he disguises himself, steals the man\u2019s home, steals his identity.","2993":"He\u2019s not a ghost, John. He\u2019s a mayfly. He lives for a day.","2994":"So \u2013 what was it he was looking for?","2995":"Job.","2996":"Obvious. You all work for the same person!","2997":"No, not the same employer. Damn.","2998":"Come on. We can do this.","2999":"Ideal night out.","3000":"Make-up.","3001":"Perfume.","3002":"Ideal man?","3003":"Oh, no.","3004":"There\u2019s a unifying factor. There has to be.","3005":"None of you reported anything stolen.","3006":"Security guard, gardener, cook, maid, private nurse. He\u2019s romancing his way up a pecking order, somebody\u2019s pecking order.","3007":"Come on, think.","3008":"Unless ...","3009":"Do you have a secret you\u2019ve never told anyone?","3010":"Gotcha.","3011":"Everyone has secrets, and they all replied too quickly.","3012":"No!","3013":"Wait!","3014":"Why? Why would he date all of those women and not return their calls?","3015":"Am I?","3016":"But why would he change his identity?","3017":"Ohh.","3018":"Married. Obvious, really. Our Mayfly Man was trying to escape the suffocating chains of domesticity ...","3019":"... and instead of endless nights in, watching the telly, or going to barbecues with awful dreadful boring people he couldn\u2019t stand, he used his wits, cleverness and powers of disguise ...  ... to play the field. He was ...","3020":"On second thoughts I probably should have told you about the Elephant in the Room. However, it does help to further illustrate how invaluable John is to me. I can read a crime scene the way he can understand a human being. I used to think that\u2019s what made me special \u2013 quite frankly, I still do. But a word to the wise: should any of you require the services of either of us, I will solve your murder, but it takes John Watson to save your life. Trust me on that \u2013 I should know. He\u2019s saved mine so many times, and in so many ways.","3021":"This blog is the story of two men and their frankly ridiculous adventures ...","3022":"... of murder, mystery and mayhem. But from now on, there\u2019s a new story \u2013 a bigger adventure.","3023":"Ladies and gentlemen, pray charge your glasses and be upstanding.","3024":"Today begin the adventures of Mary Elizabeth Watson and John Hamish Watson.","3025":"The two reasons why every single one of us is ...","3026":"What did you say?","3027":"You said, \u201cJohn Hamish Watson.\u201d You said that. You said, \u201cHamish.\u201d","3028":"... whoa, whoa!","3029":"How did you know? How did you know his middle name?  He never tells anyone. He hates it.","3030":"\u201cJohn H. Watson\u201d?","3031":"Henry?","3032":"Humphrey?","3033":"Higgins?","3034":"Took him years to confide in me. .","3035":"Yep.","3036":"And The Woman \u2013 she knew.","3037":"God knows where she is.","3038":"Out of my head. I am busy.","3039":"There\u2019s only one time that name\u2019s been made public.","3040":"It\u2019s funny.","3041":"The wedding. You knew about the wedding; more importantly, you\u2019d seen a wedding invitation. Now barely a hundred people had seen that invitation. The Mayfly Man only saw five women. For one person to be in both groups ...  ... could be a coincidence.","3042":"The universe is rarely so lazy.","3043":"Someone went to great lengths to find out something about this wedding.","3044":"They lied, assumed false identities.","3045":"Criminal intent.","3046":"Intelligence, planning.","3047":"The Mayfly Man.","3048":"The Mayfly Man is ...","3049":"... here today.","3050":"Ooh, sorry. I ...","3051":"Thank you, yes. Thank you, yes.","3052":"Now, where were we?","3053":"Ah, yes. Raising glasses and standing up. Very good. Thank you.","3054":"And down again.","3055":"Ladies and gentlemen, people tell you not to milk a good speech \u2013 get off early, leave \u2019em laughing. Wise advice I\u2019ll certainly try to bear in mind. But for now ...","3056":"... part two.","3057":"Part two is more action-based. I\u2019m gonna ... walk around, shake things up a bit.","3058":"Who\u2019d go to a wedding? That\u2019s the question. Who would bother to go to any lengths to get themselves to a wedding?","3059":"Well, everyone.","3060":"Weddings are great! Love a wedding.","3061":"And John\u2019s great, too! Haven\u2019t said that enough. Barely scratched the surface. I could go on all night about the depth and complexity of his ... jumpers ...","3062":"... and he can cook. Does ... a ... thing ... thing with peas ...","3063":"... once. Might not be peas. Might not be him. But he\u2019s got a great singing voice ... or somebody does.","3064":"Ahh, too many, too many, too many, too many!","3065":"Sorry. Too many jokes about John! Now, er ...","3066":"Where was I? Ah, yes ...","3067":"Speech!  Speech.  Let\u2019s talk about ...","3068":"... murder.","3069":"Sorry, did I say \u2018murder\u2019? I meant to say \u2018marriage\u2019 \u2013 but, you know, they\u2019re quite similar procedures when you think about it. The participants tend to know each other, and it\u2019s over when one of them\u2019s dead.","3070":"In fairness, murder is a lot quicker, though. Janine!","3071":"What about this one? Acceptably hot?  More importantly, his girlfriend\u2019s wearing brand-new uncomfortable underwear ...  ... and hasn\u2019t bothered to pick this thread off the top of his jacket ...  ... or point out the grease smudge on the back of his neck. Currently, he\u2019s going home alone. .","3072":"Also, he\u2019s a comics and sci-fi geek. They\u2019re always tremendously grateful \u2013 really put the hours in.","3073":"Geoff, the gents.","3074":"The loos, now, please.","3075":"The loos, please.","3076":"Oh, I don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s your turn.","3077":"Oh! Ladies and gentlemen, can\u2019t stand it when I finally get the chance to speak for once, Vatican Cameos.","3078":"No!","3079":": No!","3080":"Not you! Not you!","3081":"You.","3082":"It\u2019s always you. John Watson, you keep me right.","3083":"Well, you\u2019ve already done it. Don\u2019t solve the murder.  Save the life.","3084":"Sorry. Off-piste a bit. Back now.  Phew!","3085":"Let\u2019s play a game.","3086":"Let\u2019s play Murder.","3087":"Imagine someone\u2019s going to get murdered at a wedding. Who exactly would you pick?","3088":"If someone could move Mrs Hudson\u2019s glass just slightly out of reach, that would be lovely. More importantly, who could you only kill at a wedding?","3089":"Most people you can kill any old place. As a mental exercise, I\u2019ve often planned the murder of friends and colleagues.","3090":"Now John I\u2019d poison.","3091":"Sloppy eater \u2013 dead easy. I\u2019ve given him chemicals and compounds \u2013 that way, he\u2019s never even noticed. He missed a whole Wednesday once, didn\u2019t have a clue. Lestrade\u2019s so easy to kill, it\u2019s a miracle no-one\u2019s succumbed to the temptation.  I\u2019ve got a pair of keys to my brother\u2019s house \u2013 I could easily break in there and asphyxiate him.","3092":"... if, if the whim arose.","3093":"So, once again, who could you only kill here?","3094":"Clearly it\u2019s a rare opportunity, so it\u2019s someone who doesn\u2019t get out much.","3095":"Someone for whom a planned social encounter known about months in advance is an exception. Has to be a unique opportunity.","3096":"And since killing someone in public is difficult ... .","3097":"... killing them in private isn\u2019t an option. Someone who lives in an inaccessible or unknown location, then.","3098":"Someone private, perhaps, obsessed with personal security.","3099":"Possibly someone under threat.","3100":"Major James Sholto. Who he?","3101":"Ooh! A recluse, small household staff.","3102":"Job. .","3103":"High turnover for additional security.","3104":"Probably all signed confidentiality agreements.","3105":"Do you have a secret you\u2019ve never told anyone?","3106":"There is another question that remains, however \u2013 a big one, a huge one: how would you do it? How would you kill someone in public?","3107":"There has to be a way. This has been planned.","3108":"Oh, hello again, Archie.  What\u2019s your theory? Get this right and there\u2019s a headless nun in it for you.","3109":"The who, the what, the why, the when, the where?","3110":"Oh, not just planned. Planned and rehearsed.","3111":"Ladies and gentlemen, there will now be a short interlude.","3112":"The bride and groom!","3113":"Major Sholto\u2019s going to be be murdered. I don\u2019t know how or by whom, but it\u2019s going to happen.","3114":"\u2019Scuse me, coming through!","3115":"Consulting!","3116":"I have to delete something!","3117":"Major Sholto? Major Sholto!","3118":"Major Sholto!","3119":"You\u2019re not safe in there. Whoever\u2019s after you, we know that a locked room doesn\u2019t stop him.","3120":"I don\u2019t know how he does it, so I can\u2019t stop him, and that means he\u2019ll do it again.","3121":"I \u2013 I\u2019m sorry?","3122":"Sorry?","3123":"If I couldn\u2019t solve it before, how can I solve it now?","3124":"What are you talking about?  What\u2019s she talking about? Get your wife under control.","3125":"Oh, you\u2019ve changed!","3126":"Though, in fairness, he\u2019s a drama queen too.","3127":"Major Sholto, no one\u2019s coming to kill you. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve already been killed several hours ago.","3128":"Don\u2019t take off your belt.","3129":"His belt, yes. Bainbridge was stabbed hours before we even saw him, but it was through his belt.","3130":"Tight belt, worn high on the waist. Very easy to push a small blade through the fabric and you wouldn\u2019t even feel it.","3131":"Exactly.","3132":"Delayed action stabbing. All the time in the world to create an alibi.","3133":"Major Sholto?","3134":"Yes, I think we are.","3135":"Of course there is.","3136":"Of course one should, but not at John\u2019s wedding. We wouldn\u2019t do that, would we \u2013 you and me? We would never do that to John Watson.","3137":"One, two, three; der, der, der ... Ahh, pretty good.","3138":"Just ... hold your nerve on your turning.","3139":"Because we are about to dance together in public, and your skills are appalling!","3140":"Mmm.","3141":"I\u2019ll let you in on something, Janine.","3142":"I love dancing. I\u2019ve always loved it.","3143":"Watch out.","3144":"Never really comes up in crime work but, um, you know, I live in hope of the right case.","3145":"I know.","3146":"One murder... \u2013 one nearly murderer.  Loves to exaggerate. You should try living with him.","3147":"Ah, the photographer. Excellent!  Thank you.","3148":"Er, may I have a look at your camera?","3149":"You should have driven faster.","3150":"Ah, yes. Yes, very good. There, you see?  Perfect. .","3151":"Try looking yourself.","3152":"It\u2019s not what\u2019s in the photographs; it\u2019s what\u2019s not in them \u2013 not in any of them.","3153":"There is always a man at a wedding who is not in any photograph but can go anywhere, and even carry an equipment bag around with him if he likes, and you never even see his face.  You only ever see ...","3154":"... the camera.","3155":"Jonathan Small, today\u2019s substitute wedding photographer \u2013 known to us as the Mayfly Man. His brother was one of the raw recruits killed in that incursion. Jonny sought revenge on Sholto, worked his way through Sholto\u2019s staff, found what he needed ...","3156":"... an invitation to a wedding \u2013 the one time Sholto would have to be out in public. So, he made his plan ...","3157":"... and rehearsed the murder ...","3158":"... making sure of every last detail.","3159":"Brilliant, ruthless, almost certainly a monomaniac \u2013 though, in fairness, his photographs are actually quite good.","3160":"Everything you need\u2019s on that. You probably ought to ... arrest him or something.","3161":"Down, girl.","3162":"Oh, I don\u2019t do the arresting.  I just farm that out.","3163":"You should have driven faster.","3164":"Ladies and gentlemen, just, er, one last thing before the evening begins properly. Apologies for earlier. A crisis arose and was dealt with.","3165":"More importantly, however, today we saw two people make vows. I\u2019ve never made a vow in my life, and after tonight I never will again. So, here in front of you all, my first and last vow. Mary and John: whatever it takes, whatever happens, from now on I swear I will always be there, always, for all three of you.","3166":"Er, I\u2019m sorry, I mean, I mean two of you. All two of you. Both of you, in fact. I\u2019ve just miscounted.","3167":"Anyway, it\u2019s time for dancing.  Play the music again, please, thank you.","3168":"Okay, everybody, just dance. Don\u2019t be shy!","3169":"Dancing, please!","3170":"Very good!","3171":"Sorry, that was one more deduction than I was really expecting.","3172":"Increased appetite ...","3173":"... change of taste perception ...","3174":"... and you were sick this morning. You assumed it was just wedding nerves. You got angry with me when I mentioned it to you. All the signs are there.","3175":"The signs of three.","3176":"Mary, I think you should do a pregnancy test.","3177":"W... th... the statistics for the first trimester are ...","3178":"Sorry.","3179":"It\u2019s your day off.","3180":"Stop-stop panicking.","3181":"Don\u2019t panic. None of you panic.","3182":"Absolutely no reason to panic.","3183":"Yes, I would. You\u2019re already the best parents in the world. Look at all the practice you\u2019ve had!","3184":"Well, you\u2019re hardly gonna need me around now that you\u2019ve got a real baby on the way.","3185":"Dance.","3186":"Both of you, now, go dance. We can\u2019t just stand here. People will wonder what we\u2019re talking about.","3187":"Yes, there are.","3188":"Don\u2019t worry, Mary, I have been tutoring him.","3189":"Seen a lot of injuries, then? Violent deaths?","3190":"Wanna see some more?","3191":"The game is on. .","3192":"Ah, hello, John.","3193":"Didn\u2019t expect to see you here.","3194":"Did you come for me, too?","3195":"For God\u2019s sakes, John! I\u2019m on a case!","3196":"I\u2019m working.","3197":"I\u2019m undercover.","3198":"Well, I\u2019m not now!","3199":"I was undercover.","3200":"Sorry your engagement\u2019s over \u2013 though I\u2019m fairly grateful for the lack of a ring.","3201":"Please do relax. This is all for a case.","3202":"I might as well ask you why you\u2019ve started cycling to work.","3203":"Quite recently, I\u2019d say. You\u2019re very determined about it.","3204":"Yes. I think, in a way, it was.","3205":"I\u2019m sorry?","3206":"Not bad.","3207":"No \u2013 he\u2019s always walked like that. Remind me \u2013 what\u2019s your name again?","3208":"No they don\u2019t.","3209":"Nope.","3210":"Nice observational skills, Billy.","3211":"Ah! Finally.","3212":"Oh, excellent news \u2013 the best.","3213":"There\u2019s every chance that my drug habit might hit the newspapers. The game is on.","3214":"Excuse me for a second.","3215":"You\u2019ve heard of Charles Augustus Magnussen, of course.","3216":"Hang on \u2013 weren\u2019t there other people?","3217":"People were talking, none of them me. I must have filtered.","3218":"I have to filter out a lot of witless babble. I\u2019ve got Mrs Hudson on semi-permanent mute.","3219":"What is my brother doing here? .","3220":"He\u2019s straightened the knocker.","3221":"He always corrects it. He\u2019s OCD. Doesn\u2019t even know he\u2019s doing it.","3222":"Do what?","3223":"What are you doing here?","3224":"You phoned him.","3225":"\u201cWe\u201d?","3226":"For God\u2019s sake!","3227":"Anderson.","3228":"I do not have a drug habit. .","3229":"It was blocking my view to the kitchen.","3230":"Well, you were gone. I saw an opportunity.","3231":"There\u2019s nothing to find.","3232":"Okay, stop! Just stop.","3233":"Point made.","3234":"This is not what you think. This is for a case.","3235":"Magnussen.","3236":"Charles Augustus Magnussen.","3237":"Oh, you mean he\u2019s yours.","3238":"I consider you under his thumb.","3239":"Okay. I\u2019ll let you know if I notice.","3240":"Er, what was I going to say? Oh, yeah.","3241":"Bye-bye.","3242":"Brother mine, don\u2019t appal me when I\u2019m high.","3243":"What time is it?","3244":"I\u2019m meeting him in three hours. I need a bath.","3245":"Yep.","3246":"Too big and dangerous for any sane individual to get involved in.","3247":"God, no.","3248":"Trying to recruit you.","3249":"And stay out of my bedroom.","3250":"Morning.","3251":"So \u2013 it\u2019s just a guess but you\u2019ve probably got some questions.","3252":"Naturally.","3253":"Yes, I have.","3254":"Now, Magnussen. Magnussen is like a shark \u2013 it\u2019s the only way I can describe him. Have you ever been to the shark tank at the London Aquarium, John \u2013 stood up close to the glass? Those floating flat faces, those dead eyes ... That\u2019s what he is. I\u2019ve dealt with murderers, psychopaths, terrorists, serial killers. None of them can turn my stomach like Charles Augustus Magnussen.","3255":"Sorry, what?","3256":"What? Yes! Yes, I\u2019m going out with Janine. I thought that was fairly obvious.","3257":"Yes, I am.","3258":"Mmm, yes. Me and Janine.","3259":"Well, we\u2019re in a good place. It\u2019s, um ...  ... very affirming.","3260":"Everyone got that from a book.","3261":"Working.","3262":"Don\u2019t you go letting on.","3263":"Yeah!","3264":"Have a lovely day. Call me later.","3265":"You know Magnussen as a newspaper owner, but he\u2019s so much more than that.","3266":"He uses his power and wealth to gain information. The more he acquires, the greater his wealth and power.","3267":"I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say that he knows the critical pressure point on every person of note or influence in the whole of the Western world and probably beyond. He is the Napoleon of blackmail ...","3268":"... and he has created an unassailable architecture of forbidden knowledge. Its name ...","3269":"... is Appledore.","3270":"Sorry, what, dinner?","3271":"Seriously? I\u2019ve just told you that the Western world is run from this house ...  ... and you want to talk about dinner?","3272":"It is the greatest repository of sensitive and dangerous information anywhere in the world ...  ... the Alexandrian Library of secrets and scandals \u2013 and none of it is on a computer. He\u2019s smart \u2013 computers can be hacked. It\u2019s all on hard copy in vaults ...  ... underneath that house; and as long as it is, the personal freedom of anyone you\u2019ve ever met is a fantasy.","3273":"It\u2019s in the fridge. It kept ringing.","3274":"Oh, go ahead.","3275":"Oh, he\u2019s fine.","3276":"I can vouch for this man. He\u2019s a doctor. If you know who I am, then you know who he is ...","3277":"... don\u2019t you, Mr. Magnussen?","3278":"I understood we were meeting at your office.","3279":"Mr. Magnussen, I have been asked to intercede with you by Lady Elizabeth Smallwood on the matter of her husband\u2019s letters.","3280":"Some time ago you ... put pressure on her concerning those letters.","3281":"She would like those letters back.","3282":"HERLOCK HOLMES.","3283":"Obviously the letters no longer have any practical use to you, so with that in mind ...","3284":"Something I said?","3285":"I ...","3286":"I was trying to explain that I\u2019ve been asked to act on behalf of ...","3287":"I\u2019ve been asked to negotiate the return of those letters.","3288":"I\u2019m aware you do not make copies of sensitive documents ...","3289":"Am I acceptable to you as an intermediary?","3290":"Mr. Magnussen, am I acceptable to you as an intermediary?","3291":"Did you notice the one extraordinary thing he did?","3292":"Exactly \u2013 when he showed us the letters.","3293":"So he\u2019s brought the letters to London \u2013 so no matter what he says, he\u2019s ready to make a deal. Now, Magnussen only makes a deal once he\u2019s established a person\u2019s weaknesses \u2013 the \u2018pressure point\u2019, he calls it.","3294":"So, clearly he believes I\u2019m a drug addict and no serious threat.","3295":"And, of course, because he\u2019s in town tonight, the letters will be in his safe in his London office while he\u2019s out to dinner with the Marketing Group of Great Britain from seven \u2019til ten.","3296":"Because I do. Right \u2013 I\u2019ll see you tonight. I\u2019ve got some shopping to do.","3297":"I\u2019ll text instructions. .","3298":"You are! I checked!","3299":"Don\u2019t bring a gun.","3300":"Or a knife, or a tyre lever. Probably best not to do any arm-spraining, but we\u2019ll see how the night goes.","3301":"Time you got out of the house, John.  You\u2019ve put on seven pounds since you got married, and the cycling isn\u2019t doing it.","3302":"Mary and I think seven. See you later.","3303":"Hatton Garden.","3304":"Magnussen\u2019s office is on the top floor, just below his private flat ...  ... but there are fourteen levels of security between us and him ...","3305":"... two of which aren\u2019t even legal in this country. Want to know how we\u2019re going to break in?","3306":"Of course it\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.","3307":"Magnussen\u2019s private lift. It goes straight to his penthouse and office. Only he uses it ...  ... and only his key card calls the lift. Anyone else even tries, security is automatically informed.","3308":"Standard key card for the building. Nicked it yesterday. Only gets us as far as the canteen.","3309":"Here we go, then.","3310":"If I was to use this card on that lift now, what happens?","3311":"Do we really need so much colour?","3312":"But if I do this ...","3313":"If you press a key card against your mobile phone for long enough, it corrupts the magnetic strip. The card stops working. It\u2019s a common problem \u2013 never put your key card with your phone.","3314":"What happens if I use the card now?","3315":"But it doesn\u2019t read as the wrong card now.","3316":"It registers as corrupted. But if it\u2019s corrupted, how do they know it\u2019s not Magnussen?","3317":"Would they risk dragging him off?","3318":"So what do they do? What do they have to do?","3319":"There\u2019s a camera at eye height to the right of the door.","3320":"A live picture of the card user is relayed directly to Magnussen\u2019s personal staff in his office \u2013 the only people trusted to make a positive ID.","3321":"... at this hour, almost certainly his PA.","3322":"Human error.  I\u2019ve been shopping.","3323":"Here we go, then.","3324":"Which, in this case, is a considerable advantage.","3325":"Hi, Janine.  Go on, let me in.","3326":"Don\u2019t make me do it out here. Not ...  ... in front of everyone. .","3327":"You see? As long as there\u2019s people, there\u2019s always a weak spot.","3328":"Yes, of course it was Janine. She\u2019s Magnussen\u2019s PA. That\u2019s the whole point.","3329":"Yeah.  Stroke of luck, meeting her at your wedding. You can take some of the credit.","3330":"Yes. Like I said \u2013 human error.","3331":"Well, not actually marry her, obviously.  There\u2019s only so far you can go.","3332":"Well, I\u2019ll tell her that our entire relationship was a ruse to break into her boss\u2019 office. I imagine she\u2019ll want to stop seeing me at that point ...","3333":"... but you\u2019re the expert on women.","3334":"It\u2019s a bit rude. I just proposed to her.","3335":"Did she faint? Do they really do that?","3336":"Another in here.","3337":"Security.","3338":"Ex-con.","3339":"White supremacist, by the tattoo, so who cares?  Stick with Janine.","3340":"So\u2019s Magnussen. His seat\u2019s still warm. He should be at dinner but he\u2019s still in the building.","3341":"Upstairs!","3342":"During our own burglary?! You\u2019re really not a natural at this, are you?","3343":"No, wait, shh!","3344":"Perfume \u2013 not Janine\u2019s.","3345":"Why do I know it?","3346":"No, not Mary. Somebody else.","3347":"Additionally, if you\u2019re going to commit murder, you might consider changing your perfume ...","3348":"... Lady Smallwood.","3349":"He\u2019s, um ...","3350":"He-he\u2019s downstairs.","3351":"Mary, whatever he\u2019s got on you, let me help.","3352":"No, Mrs Watson.","3353":"You won\u2019t.","3354":"Mary?","3355":"Blood loss.","3356":"Sorry?","3357":"That one, I think.","3358":"Or that one.","3359":"The mirror shattering.","3360":"The bullet\u2019s still inside me.","3361":"What the hell is that? What\u2019s happening?","3362":"What do I do?","3363":"It\u2019s coming to get you.","3364":"Hello, Redbeard. Here, boy. Come on!","3365":"Come to me. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s all right.","3366":"Come on!","3367":"Hello, Redbeard. They\u2019re putting me down too, now. It\u2019s no fun, is it?","3368":"Redbeard.","3369":"Control! Control! Control.","3370":"You.","3371":"You never felt pain, did you? Why did you never feel pain?","3372":"John!","3373":"Mary.","3374":"You didn\u2019t give these stories to Magnussen, did you?","3375":"And you \u2013 as it turns out \u2013 are a grasping, opportunistic, publicity-hungry tabloid whore.","3376":"Yeah, of course.  Where\u2019s the cottage?","3377":"Hmm, nice.","3378":"How much more revenge are you gonna need?","3379":"Not good for working.","3380":"I exploited the fact of our connection.","3381":"Hmm?","3382":"Oh.  I was waiting until we got married.","3383":"So ...","3384":"... you\u2019re Mary Watson. Who are you?","3385":"Mary Watson.","3386":"Can\u2019t you see me?","3387":"The lie \u2013 the lie of Leinster Gardens \u2013 hidden in plain sight.","3388":"Hardly anyone notices. People live here for years and never see it, but if you are what I think you are, it\u2019ll take you less than a minute.","3389":"The houses, Mary. Look at the houses.","3390":"I knew you\u2019d talk to the people no one else would bother with.","3391":"You\u2019re always clever, Mary. I was relying on that. I planted the information for you to find.","3392":"Thirty seconds.","3393":"No door knobs, no letter box ...","3394":"... painted windows. Twenty-three and twenty-four Leinster Gardens ...","3395":"... the empty houses.","3396":"They were demolished years ago to make way for the London Underground, a vent for the old steam trains.","3397":"Only the very front section of the house remains. It\u2019s just a fa\u00e7ade.  Remind you of anyone, Mary? A fa\u00e7ade.","3398":"Sorry. I never could resist a touch of drama.","3399":"Do come in. It\u2019s a little cramped.","3400":"Mmm. I won it in a card game with the Clarence House Cannibal.","3401":"Nearly cost me my kidneys, but fortunately I had a ...  ... straight flush.","3402":"Quite a gambler, that woman.","3403":"Mary Morstan was stillborn in October 1972. Her gravestone is in Chiswick Cemetery where \u2013 five years ago \u2013 you acquired her name and date of birth and thereafter her identity.","3404":"That\u2019s why you don\u2019t have \u2018friends\u2019 from before that date.","3405":"Need to work on your half of the church, Mary. Looking a bit thin.","3406":"It\u2019s an old enough technique, known to the kinds of people who can recognise a skip-code on sight ...","3407":"... have extraordinarily retentive memories ...","3408":"I have to delete something!","3409":"How good a shot are you?","3410":"If I die here, my body will be found in a building with your face projected on the front of it. Even Scotland Yard could get somewhere with that.","3411":"I want to know how good you are.  Go on. Show me. The doctor\u2019s wife must be a little bit bored by now.","3412":"May I see?","3413":"And yet, over a distance of six feet, you failed to make a kill shot.","3414":"Enough to hospitalise me; not enough to kill me. That wasn\u2019t a miss.","3415":"That was surgery.","3416":"I\u2019ll take the case.","3417":"Yours.  Why didn\u2019t you come to me in the first place? .","3418":"Sorry.","3419":"Not that obvious a trick.","3420":"Now talk, and sort it out. Do it quickly.","3421":"I invited him.","3422":"No.","3423":"Closer.","3424":"Probably stop talking now.","3425":"Well, you know \u2013 they\u2019ve had their ups and downs.","3426":"Baker Street. Now.","3427":"Get me some morphine from your kitchen. I\u2019ve run out.","3428":"Then what exactly is the point of you?","3429":"The Watsons are about to have a domestic, and fairly quickly, I hope, because we\u2019ve got work to do.","3430":"Yes.","3431":"Good that we\u2019ve settled that. Anyway, we ...","3432":"I didn\u2019t say it was funny.","3433":"Everything.","3434":"Oh, I mean it, seriously. Everything \u2013 everything you\u2019ve ever done is what you did.","3435":"You were a doctor who went to war.","3436":"You\u2019re a man who couldn\u2019t stay in the suburbs for more than a month without storming a crack den and beating up a junkie. Your best friend is a sociopath who solves crimes as an alternative to getting high.","3437":"That\u2019s me, by the way.  Hello. .","3438":"Even the landlady used to run a drug cartel.","3439":"And exotic dancing.","3440":"John, you are addicted to a certain lifestyle. You\u2019re abnormally attracted to dangerous situations and people ...  ... so is it truly such a surprise that the woman you\u2019ve fallen in love with conforms to that pattern?","3441":"Because you chose her.","3442":"John, listen. Be calm and answer me.  What is she?","3443":"No. What is she?","3444":"No. Not in this flat; not in this room. Right here, right now, what is she?","3445":"A.G.R.A. What\u2019s that?","3446":"By your skill set, you are \u2013 or were \u2013 an intelligence agent. Your accent is currently English but I suspect you are not. You\u2019re on the run from something; you\u2019ve used your skills to disappear; ...","3447":"... Magnussen knows your secret, which is why you were going to kill him; and I assume you befriended Janine ...  ... in order to get close to him.","3448":"So ... Mary ...","3449":"... any documents that Magnussen has concerning yourself, you want ...  ... extracted and returned.","3450":"Because ... you saved my life.","3451":"When I happened on you and Magnussen ...","3452":"... you had a problem.","3453":"More specifically, you had a witness.","3454":"The solution, of course, was simple. Kill us both and leave.","3455":"However, sentiment got the better of you.","3456":"One precisely-calculated shot to incapacitate me ...","3457":"... in the hope that it would bide you more time to negotiate my silence.","3458":"Of course, you couldn\u2019t shoot Magnussen.  On the night that both of us broke into the building, your own husband would become a suspect, so ...","3459":"... you calculated ... that Magnussen ... would use the fact of your involvement rather than sharing the information with the police ... as is his M.O.","3460":"... and then you left the way you came.","3461":"Have I missed anything?","3462":"She phoned the ambulance.","3463":"She phoned first.","3464":"You didn\u2019t find me for another five minutes. Left to you, I would have died. The average arrival time for a London ambulance is ...","3465":"... eight minutes. .","3466":"Did you bring any morphine? I asked on the phone.","3467":"There was, last week ...","3468":"... but I believe I\u2019m bleeding internally and my pulse is very erratic.","3469":"You may need to re-start my heart on the way.","3470":"John?","3471":"John \u2013 Magnussen is all that matters now. You can trust Mary. She saved my life.","3472":"Er, mixed messages, I grant you.","3473":"Are you?","3474":"Because he attacks people who are different and preys on their secrets. Why don\u2019t you?","3475":"A dragon slayer. Is that what you think of me?","3476":"It was Mycroft.","3477":"I decline your kind offer.","3478":"What was it?","3479":"Then why don\u2019t you want me to take it?","3480":"Utility How do I have utility?","3481":"You need low tar. You still smoke like a beginner.","3482":"What the hell am I supposed to say to that?!","3483":"You hate Christmas.","3484":"Clearly. Go and have some more.","3485":"Don\u2019t drink Mary\u2019s tea.","3486":"Oh, or the punch.","3487":"Don\u2019t worry. Wiggins is an excellent chemist. .","3488":"He\u2019ll monitor their recovery. It\u2019s more or less his day job.","3489":"... A deal with the devil.","3490":"I am in hospital. This is the canteen.","3491":"In my opinion, yes.","3492":"Have a seat.","3493":"I\u2019ve been thinking about you.","3494":"Really?","3495":"I want to see Appledore, where you keep all the secrets, all the files, everything you\u2019ve got on everyone. I want you to invite me.","3496":"Oh, I think you\u2019re a lot more \u2018careless\u2019 than you let on.","3497":"It\u2019s the dead-eye stare that gives it away.","3498":"Except it\u2019s not dead-eyed, is it?","3499":"You\u2019re reading.","3500":"Portable Appledore.  How does it work?","3501":"Built-in flash drive?  4G wireless?","3502":"They\u2019re just ordinary spectacles.","3503":"Impress me, then. Show me Appledore.","3504":"A Christmas present.","3505":"My brother.","3506":"I\u2019d rather keep you guessing.","3507":"Ah.  There\u2019s our lift.","3508":"Coming?","3509":"D\u2019you want your wife to be safe?","3510":"Good, because this is going to be incredibly dangerous.  One false move and we\u2019ll have betrayed the security of the United Kingdom and be in prison for high treason. Magnussen is quite simply the most dangerous man we\u2019ve ever encountered, and the odds are comprehensively stacked against us.","3511":"I feel the same.","3512":"Oh, you mean it\u2019s actually Christmas. Did you bring your gun as I suggested?","3513":"Is it in your coat?","3514":"Off we go, then.","3515":"Appledore.","3516":"Oh. It was you.","3517":"Mm.","3518":"It\u2019s an exchange, not a gift.","3519":"It\u2019s password protected.","3520":"In return for the password, you will give me any material in your possession pertaining to the woman I know as Mary Watson.","3521":"Then why don\u2019t you show us?","3522":"I want everything you\u2019ve got on Mary.","3523":"Oh, I think you\u2019ll find the contents of that laptop ...","3524":"The fact that you know it\u2019s going to happen isn\u2019t going to stop it.","3525":"Let him. I\u2019m sorry. .","3526":"Just ... let him.","3527":"To clarify: Appledore\u2019s vaults only exist in your mind, nowhere else, just there. .","3528":"Oh, do your research.","3529":"I\u2019m not a hero ...","3530":"... I\u2019m a high-functioning sociopath.","3531":"Merry Christmas!","3532":"Get away from me, John!  Stay well back!","3533":"Give my love to Mary.","3534":"Tell her she\u2019s safe now.","3535":"You will look after him for me, won\u2019t you?","3536":"That\u2019s my girl.","3537":"Since this is likely to be the last conversation I\u2019ll have with John Watson ...","3538":"... would you mind if we took a moment?","3539":"William Sherlock Scott Holmes.","3540":"That\u2019s the whole of it \u2013 if you\u2019re looking for baby names.","3541":"Oh.  Okay.","3542":"No, neither can I.","3543":"The game is never over, John ...  ... but there may be some new players now. It\u2019s okay. The East Wind takes us all in the end. .","3544":"It\u2019s a story my brother told me when we were kids. The East Wind \u2013 this terrifying force that lays waste to all in its path.","3545":"It seeks out the unworthy ...  ... and plucks them from the Earth. That was generally me.","3546":"He was a rubbish big brother.","3547":"Oh, some undercover work in Eastern Europe.","3548":"Six months, my brother estimates. He\u2019s never wrong. .","3549":"Who knows?","3550":"John, there\u2019s something ... I should say; I-I\u2019ve meant to say always and then never have. Since it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll ever meet again, I might as well say it now.","3551":"Sherlock is actually a girl\u2019s name.","3552":"It was worth a try.","3553":"I think it could work.","3554":"To the very best of times, John.","3555":"Mycroft?","3556":"I\u2019ve only been gone four minutes.","3557":"Oh, for God\u2019s sake. Make up your mind. Who needs me this time?","3558":"No.","3559":"Of course I\u2019m not tweeting. Why would I be tweeting?","3560":"What? No. Get off. What are you doing?","3561":"Get off. What ...?","3562":"Don\u2019t read them out.","3563":"God, you\u2019re such a spoilsport.","3564":"I am taking it seriously. What makes you think I\u2019m not taking it seriously?","3565":"Look, not so long ago I was on a mission that meant certain death \u2013 my death \u2013 and now I\u2019m back, in a nice warm office with my big brother and ... Are those ginger nuts?","3566":"Love ginger nuts.","3567":"I am, utterly.  No need for stimulants now, remember? I have work to do.","3568":"Natural high, I assure you. Totally natural. I\u2019m just ...  ...  glad to be aliiiiiive! .","3569":"What shall we do next?  What\u2019s your name?","3570":"What would you do, Vivian?","3571":"Well, it\u2019s a lovely day. Go for a stroll?","3572":"Make a paper aeroplane? Have an ice lolly? .","3573":"Ice lolly it is! What\u2019s your favourite?","3574":"Go on.","3575":"Do your research.","3576":"I\u2019m not a hero. I\u2019m a high functioning sociopath.","3577":"... sociopath.","3578":"... sociopath.","3579":"I see. Who is supposed to have shot him, then?","3580":"That\u2019s not what happened at all. .","3581":"Okay, cheers.","3582":"I told you. Moriarty\u2019s dead.","3583":"Yes.","3584":"No, no. He would never be that disappointing.  He\u2019s planned something; something long-term; something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive. Posthumous revenge. No \u2013 better than that. Posthumous game.","3585":"Wait.","3586":"Of course wait. I\u2019m the target. Targets wait. Look \u2013 whatever\u2019s coming, whatever he\u2019s lined up, I\u2019ll know when it begins.","3587":"I always know when the game is on. D\u2019you know why?","3588":"Because I love it.","3589":"There was once a merchant in the famous market at Baghdad. One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise ...","3590":"... and he knew that the stranger was Death. Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles to the city of Samarra, for there he was sure Death could not find him.","3591":"But when at last he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death. \u201cVery well,\u201d said the merchant. \u201cI give in. I am yours.\u201d","3592":"\u201cBut tell me: why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?\u201d \u201cBecause,\u201d said Death, \u201cI had an appointment with you tonight \u2013 in Samarra.\u201d","3593":"If this gets any better, I\u2019m gonna get two knives.","3594":"Ooh, I have a plan.","3595":"I\u2019m going to monitor the underworld \u2013 every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.","3596":"Awesome, isn\u2019t it?!","3597":"Superficial.","3598":"Come back! It\u2019s the wrong thumb!","3599":"It\u2019s never twins.","3600":"Hopkins, arrest Wilson. Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.","3601":"Yes. You may have nothing but a limbless torso but there\u2019ll still be traces of ink left in the lymph nodes under the armpits. If your mystery corpse had tattoos, the signs\u2019ll be there.","3602":"I never guess.","3603":"\u2019Course he\u2019s the killer.","3604":"Hm, naturally.","3605":"That\u2019s it! The place was spinning.","3606":"The heart medication you are taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia.","3607":"Because the fingerprints on your brother\u2019s neck are your own.","3608":"I know.","3609":"Well, you could try.","3610":"Mary?","3611":"We\u2019re in a lot of trouble.","3612":"That\u2019s it, Mary. Re... .","3613":"...lax.","3614":"Oh my God.","3615":"Well, you know what I think.","3616":"You too what?","3617":"God is a ludicrous fiction dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.","3618":"I\u2019ll get back to you.","3619":"Rosamund? .","3620":"No. I delete his texts. I delete any text that begins, \u2018Hi.\u2019","3621":"As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.","3622":"To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery whereas, to me, it is an open book. Hard logic versus romantic whimsy. That is your choice. You fail to connect actions to their consequences. Now, for the last time ...  ... if you want to keep the rattle ...","3623":"... do not throw the rattle, hm?","3624":"Who cares about that? Tell me about the seats.","3625":"Yes. The car seats.","3626":"Made of vinyl ... two different types of vinyl present.","3627":"Was it his own car?","3628":"Well, that\u2019s suggestive.","3629":"Vinyl\u2019s cheaper than leather.","3630":"Yes?","3631":"What?","3632":"Oh, this is a good one.  Is it my birthday? You want help?","3633":"One condition.","3634":"Take all the credit.","3635":"It gets boring if I just solve them all.","3636":"Okay.","3637":"Anything you say, Giles.","3638":"Just kidding.","3639":"What is it?","3640":"What?","3641":"Oh.","3642":"John, you amaze me. You know what happened?","3643":"Mm. Well, then ...","3644":"... let\u2019s help you solve your little problem, Greg.","3645":"I\u2019m sorry, what?","3646":"Are you two having a little joke?","3647":"This is a joke, isn\u2019t it?","3648":"Is it about me?","3649":"No, don\u2019t get it.","3650":"You know me.","3651":"How do you know about that?","3652":"Solved it, then?","3653":"Oh, Mary, motherhood\u2019s slowing you down.","3654":"Keep trying.","3655":"Don\u2019t give it a title.","3656":"I hate the titles.","3657":"No, never do that. People are stupid.","3658":"All people are stupid. ... Most people.","3659":"Mr and Mrs Welsborough.  I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.","3660":"Son.","3661":"Well, I believe that I ...","3662":"... can.","3663":"Sorry. You were saying?","3664":"No, shouldn\u2019t think so.","3665":"So sorry. Will you excuse me a moment? I just ...","3666":"Not sure. I just ... \u2018By the pricking of my thumbs.\u2019","3667":"Intuitions are not to be ignored, John. They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.","3668":"What is this?","3669":"Right, yes.","3670":"Who?","3671":"Who-who is this? .","3672":"Right.","3673":"Prime minister?","3674":"Right.","3675":"Female?","3676":"It\u2019s the gap.  Look at the gap. It\u2019s wrong. Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed ...","3677":"This whole thing\u2019s verging on OCD.","3678":"My respects. This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner\u2019s been in.  This picture\u2019s straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains.  Something\u2019s missing from here, but only recently. .","3679":"... plaster bust.","3680":"Rug!","3681":"Well, how could it get broken? The only place for it to fall is the floor, and there is a big thick rug.","3682":"The porch where we came in?","3683":"I\u2019m no expert but, er, possibly her face?","3684":"Why didn\u2019t he smash all the others? Perfect opportunity, and look at that one.  She\u2019s smiling in that one.","3685":"I know what happened to your son.","3686":"It\u2019s quite simple. Superficial, to be blunt. But first, tell me: the night of the break-in. This room was in darkness?","3687":"And the porch where it was smashed: I noticed the motion sensor was damaged, so I assume it\u2019s permanently lit.","3688":"I lack the arrogance to ignore details. I\u2019m not the police.","3689":"Exactly.","3690":"Dunno. Wouldn\u2019t be fun if I knew.","3691":"It was your fiftieth birthday, Mr Welsborough; of course you were disappointed that your son hadn\u2019t made it back from his gap year. After all, he was in Tibet.","3692":"No.","3693":"The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video. Easily arranged.","3694":"The trick was meant to be a surprise.","3695":"Obviously.","3696":"There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car: one the actual passenger seat; the other a good copy. Well, good enough.","3697":"Effectively a costume.","3698":"No, I\u2019m not. What he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.","3699":"That\u2019s when it happened.","3700":"I can\u2019t be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure. You said he\u2019d felt unwell?","3701":"He died there and then. No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained in the driver\u2019s seat hidden until ...","3702":"When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who\u2019d been sitting there quite dead for a week.","3703":"Really, I\u2019m so sorry. Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.","3704":"This is where it was smashed.","3705":"What?","3706":"Ancient history. Why are you still talking about it?","3707":"Can\u2019t stand it. Never can. There\u2019s a loose thread in the world.","3708":"What kind of a life would that be? Besides, I have the strangest feeling.","3709":"That\u2019s mine. You two take a ... bus.","3710":"I need to concentrate, and I don\u2019t want to hit you.","3711":"The Mall, please.","3712":"Thatcher?","3713":"You thought that?!","3714":"That\u2019s her. John and Mary\u2019s baby.","3715":"Is that really the best you can do?","3716":"Babies?","3717":"Moriarty. Did he have any connection with Thatcher? Any interest in her?","3718":"I don\u2019t know. You tell me.","3719":"It\u2019s a pearl. Get another one.","3720":"There\u2019s something important about this.","3721":"I\u2019m sure. Maybe it\u2019s Moriarty. Maybe it\u2019s not. But something\u2019s coming.","3722":"The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other. What we call premonition is just movement of the web. If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable, as inevitable as mathematics.","3723":"I\u2019m sorry?","3724":"I\u2019m not sure I like it now.","3725":"Goodnight, Mycroft. .","3726":"Keep me informed.","3727":"Absolutely no idea.","3728":"Will you two please keep it down?","3729":"Now, you haven\u2019t always been in life insurance, have you? You started out in manual labour.","3730":"Oh, don\u2019t bother being astonished. Your right hand\u2019s almost an entire size bigger than your left.","3731":"Hard manual work does that.","3732":"And you\u2019re trying to give up smoking, unsuccessfully, and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.","3733":"Not just that \u2013 ten individual e-cigarettes. Now, if you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would have invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things, but you\u2019re convinced you can give up, so you don\u2019t want to buy a pipe because that means you\u2019re not serious about quitting, so instead you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last. Anything to add, John?","3734":"John?","3735":"What is that?","3736":"Don\u2019t be so hard on yourself.","3737":"You know I value your little contributions.","3738":"Has it? Where were you?","3739":"What?","3740":"You\u2019ve got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name \u2018Akako.\u2019","3741":"It\u2019s obvious you\u2019ve tried to have it removed.","3742":"If she\u2019d really hurt your feelings, you would have had the word obliterated, but the first attempt wasn\u2019t successful and you haven\u2019t tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.","3743":"I\u2019ve withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it\u2019s time you knew the truth.","3744":"Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?","3745":"You thought she was having an affair. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s far worse than that. Your wife is a spy.","3746":"That\u2019s right. Her real name is Greta Bengtsdotter.  Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world. She\u2019s been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife for one reason only: to get near the American embassy which is across the road from your flat. Tomorrow the US president will be at the embassy as part of an official state visit. As the president greets members of staff, Greta Bengtsdotter, disguised as a twenty-two stone cleaner, will inject the president in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit. This drug will then render the president entirely susceptible to the will of their new master, none other than James Moriarty.","3747":"Moriarty will then use the president as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first strike policy against Russia. This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating ...  ... World War Three.","3748":"No, of course not.  His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.","3749":"Get out.","3750":"Having fun.","3751":"While I can.","3752":"Borgia Pearl, boring, go.","3753":"Go!","3754":"Oh, this had better be good.","3755":"I am pleased.","3756":"This is my game face.","3757":"And the game is on.","3758":"No, no good. There were other images of Margaret ...  ... Margaret?","3759":"... Thatcher present at the first break-in. Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one?","3760":"Ooh.","3761":"Blood.  Quite a bit of it, too.","3762":"Was there any injury at the crime scene?","3763":"Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.","3764":"Come on.","3765":"Lambeth.","3766":"To see Toby.","3767":"You\u2019ll see.","3768":"No. He\u2019s got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn\u2019t want to be late for. .","3769":"The right sleeve of your jacket ...  ... plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne ...","3770":"... and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch. Have a good time.","3771":"Trust me, though, she\u2019s not right for you.","3772":"She\u2019s not the one.","3773":"She\u2019s got three children in Rio that he doesn\u2019t know about.","3774":"Possibly.","3775":"There\u2019s a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker, one of the world\u2019s best. He got himself into serious trouble with the Americans a couple of years ago. He hacked into the Pentagon\u2019s security system, and I managed to get him off the charge. Therefore he owes me a favour.","3776":"What?","3777":"Toby\u2019s not the hacker.","3778":"All right, Craig?","3779":"Craig\u2019s got a dog!","3780":"Good boy!","3781":"Hey.","3782":"She\u2019s better at this than you.","3783":"So I texted her.","3784":"Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill set. Of course she\u2019s better.","3785":"Nothing personal.","3786":"John or the dog?","3787":"Well ...","3788":"Mm.","3789":"Barnicot\u2019s house, then. Anyone up for a trudge?","3790":"Keep up. He\u2019s fast.","3791":"He\u2019s thinking.","3792":"Slow but sure, John; not dissimilar to yourself.","3793":"Well, I like you.","3794":"Fascinating.","3795":"Well? What do you make of it?","3796":"Yes, but it wasn\u2019t a burglar. They came specifically for that Thatcher bust. Why?","3797":"Clever.","3798":"Or blood in a butchers\u2019.","3799":"Never mind, Toby. Better luck next time, hm?","3800":"This is it, though. This is the one.  I can feel it.","3801":"It has to be him. It\u2019s too bizarre; it\u2019s too baroque.  It\u2019s designed to beguile me, tease me, lure me in. At last \u2013 a noose for me to put my neck into.","3802":"You\u2019re going to have to be more specific, Craig.","3803":"Mm. .","3804":"Yes, fascinating, irrelevant. Where exactly did they come from?","3805":"Where exactly?","3806":"Lestrade, another one?","3807":"Harker or Sandeford?","3808":"Hm, that perks things up a bit.","3809":"The same thing inside the house? The bust?","3810":"Interesting. That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago \u2013 limited edition of six.","3811":"No, they\u2019re not destroying them. That\u2019s not what\u2019s happening.","3812":"Well, it is what\u2019s happening, but it\u2019s not the point. I\u2019ve been slow; far too slow.","3813":"Slow but lucky; very lucky. And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold. Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I\u2019m going next. Congratulations, by the way.","3814":"Well, you\u2019re about to solve a big one.","3815":"Yeah. \u2019Til then, basically.","3816":"Wouldn\u2019t it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?","3817":"You were on the run; nowhere to hide your precious cargo.","3818":"You find yourself in a workshop. Plaster busts of The Iron Lady drying. It\u2019s clever, very clever. But now you\u2019ve met me, and you\u2019re not so clever, are you?","3819":"My name is Sherlock Holmes.","3820":"You\u2019re out of time. Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.","3821":"I know it\u2019s him. It must be him.","3822":"Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don\u2019t we just enjoy the moment?","3823":"Let me present Interpol\u2019s number one case. Too tough for them; too boring for me.","3824":"The Black Pearl of the Borgias.","3825":"It\u2019s not possible. How could she ...?","3826":"I don\u2019t understand.","3827":"She ... she destroyed it.","3828":"Mary. This is about Mary.","3829":"She\u2019s my friend, and she\u2019s under my protection. Who are you?","3830":"Not a policeman.","3831":"Well?","3832":"I very much doubt it.","3833":"Because I think he used to work with Mary.","3834":"I am an idiot. I know nothing.","3835":"I was so convinced it was Moriarty, I couldn\u2019t see what was right under my nose.","3836":"I expected a pearl.","3837":"Yes, it\u2019s an AGRA memory stick like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else. Who?","3838":"I glanced at it, but I\u2019d prefer to hear it from you.","3839":"Because I\u2019ll know the truth when I hear it.","3840":"Not just agents.","3841":"Who employed you?","3842":"Who from?","3843":"\u201cAmmo\u201d?","3844":"No.","3845":"I met someone tonight: the same someone who\u2019s looking for the sixth Thatcher.","3846":"Yeah, very much so. .","3847":"Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?","3848":"So Ajay survived as well, and now he\u2019s looking for the memory stick he managed to hide with all of AGRA\u2019s old aliases on it. But why?","3849":"Tbilisi was six years ago. Where\u2019s he been?","3850":"Mary, I\u2019m sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.","3851":"Families fall out. The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down. You\u2019re the only other survivor. It must be you that he wants, and he\u2019s already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.","3852":"I heard it from his own mouth. \u201cTell her she\u2019s a dead woman walking.\u201d","3853":"He said you betrayed him.","3854":"Well, it\u2019s what he believes.","3855":"Yes, well he\u2019s a very tangible ghost.","3856":"No. Mary, you do. I made a vow, remember?","3857":"To look after the three of you.","3858":"Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him. I promise you.","3859":"What is it?","3860":"What are you ...?","3861":"Mary.","3862":"Oh, no.","3863":"No.","3864":"What are you, Wikipedia?","3865":"AGRA is an acronym.","3866":"Team of agents, the best. But you know all that.","3867":"One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.","3868":"Is it?","3869":"He\u2019s already killed looking for that memory stick. AGRA always worked for the highest bidder. I thought that might include you.","3870":"Well, I mean the British government or whatever government you\u2019re currently propping up.","3871":"Your initiative?","3872":"There was something else; a detail, a code word.","3873":"It\u2019s all I\u2019ve got.","3874":"Could you do some digging, as a favour?","3875":"Then I\u2019m calling them all in.","3876":"Of course.","3877":"No. It\u2019s me.","3878":"Told you: I made a promise, a vow.","3879":"Not on my watch.","3880":"Mr Baker. Well, that completes the set.","3881":"Well, who else am I missing?","3882":"Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m not familiar with the concept.  Oh, hi, Mary.","3883":"Happy families.","3884":"Nice trip?","3885":"Please, Mary. There is a child present.","3886":"Karim let me in.","3887":"Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?","3888":"Thank you.","3889":"I\u2019m Sherlock Holmes.","3890":"Mary, no human action is ever truly random.  An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual can reduce the number of variables considerably.","3891":"I myself know of at least fifty-eight techniques to refine this seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.","3892":"But they\u2019re really difficult, so instead I just ... stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.","3893":"I know, but your face!","3894":"You believed that.","3895":"Yes. I started to run out about then.","3896":"I will keep you safe.","3897":"But it has to be in London. It\u2019s my city; I know the turf.","3898":"Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.","3899":"Get down!","3900":"How did you find us?","3901":"What did you hear, Ajay? When you were a prisoner, what exactly did you hear?","3902":"And they said it was her?","3903":"They said her name?","3904":"The English woman. That\u2019s all he heard. Naturally he assumed it was Mary.","3905":"No, it\u2019s not over. Ajay said that they\u2019d been betrayed. The hostage takers knew AGRA were coming. There was only a voice on the phone, remember, and a code word.","3906":"How\u2019s your Latin, brother dear?","3907":"Amo, amas, amat.","3908":"Not \u2018ammo\u2019 as in \u2018ammunition\u2019 but \u2018amo,\u2019 meaning ...?","3909":"Your office said I\u2019d find you here.","3910":"Predatory.","3911":"Nice location for the final act. Couldn\u2019t have chosen it better myself. But then I never could resist a touch of the dramatic.","3912":"I really am a very busy man. Would you mind cutting to the chase?","3913":"With good reason.","3914":"I really have never liked this story.","3915":"Hello, Mary.","3916":"John?","3917":"Let me introduce Amo.","3918":"Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.","3919":"Oh, let me guess. Selling secrets?","3920":"But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.","3921":"What you didn\u2019t know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.","3922":"Mary, no!","3923":"Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.","3924":"... for a secretary.","3925":"Can\u2019t have been easy all those years, sitting in the back keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.","3926":"No? Same old drudge, day in, day out, never getting out there where all the excitement was. Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.","3927":"They\u2019ve taken up the pavement outside the Post Office there. The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.","3928":"Yes, your little flat.","3929":"Well, on your salary it would have to be modest and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn\u2019t you, and what are you, widowed or divorced?  Wedding ring\u2019s at least thirty years old and you\u2019ve moved it to another finger. That means you\u2019re sentimentally attached to it but you\u2019re not still married. I favour widowed, given the number of cats you share your life with.","3930":"Two Burmese and a tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.","3931":"A divorcee\u2019s more likely to look for a new partner; a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.","3932":"Pets do that, or so I\u2019m told, and there\u2019s clearly no-one new in your life, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium. That probably accounts for the drink problem, too: the slight tremor in your hand ...  ... the red wine stain ghosting your top lip. So yes. I say jealousy was your motive after all \u2013 to prove how good you are ...","3933":"... to make up for the inadequacies of your little life.","3934":"Vivian Norbury, who outsmarted them all. All except Sherlock Holmes.","3935":"There\u2019s no way out.","3936":"It\u2019s what I do.","3937":"Everything\u2019s fine. It\u2019s gonna be okay.","3938":"Get an ambulance.","3939":"It\u2019s all right, it\u2019s all right.","3940":"Yes?","3941":"Yes. Yes, y-you did.","3942":"It\u2019s-it\u2019s all right.","3943":"Okay.","3944":"That\u2019s not really my style.","3945":"I need to know what to do.","3946":"About John.","3947":"I\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t.","3948":"Just going to, um ...  ... look through these things. There might be a case.","3949":"Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.","3950":"Mrs Hudson?","3951":"If you ever think I\u2019m becoming a bit ...  ... full of myself, cocky or ...  ... over-confident ...","3952":"... would you just say the word \u2018Norbury\u2019 to me, would you?","3953":"Just that.  I\u2019d be very grateful.","3954":"What\u2019s this?","3955":"Must be.","3956":"I knew it wouldn\u2019t end like this. I knew Moriarty made plans.","3957":"I just ... wondered how things were going and ... and if there was anything I could do.","3958":"Right.","3959":"Yes?","3960":"When does the path we walk on lock around our feet? When does the road become a river with only one destination? Death waits for us all in Samarra. But can Samarra be avoided?","3961":"What word?","3962":"What name?","3963":"Well, you\u2019ve changed. You no longer top up your tan and your roots are showing.","3964":"Letting yourself go?","3965":"No. Do you own an American car?","3966":"No, not American; left-hand drive, that\u2019s what I mean.","3967":"Not sure, actually.  Probably just noticed something.","3968":"Oh, of course you don\u2019t own a car. You don\u2019t need one, do you, living in isolation, no human contact, no visitors.","3969":"It\u2019s all here, isn\u2019t it? Look.","3970":"Cost-cutting\u2019s clearly a priority for you. Look at the size of your kitchen: teeny-tiny.  Must be a bit annoying when you\u2019re such a keen cook.","3971":"Hang on a minute ...  ... I was looking out of the window. Why was I doing that?","3972":"Me either. Must have had a reason.  It\u2019ll come back to me.","3973":"Presumably you downsized when you ... when you left your job ...  ... and maybe when you ended your relationship.","3974":"\u2019Course I can. There wasn\u2019t anything physical going on, was there?  Quite some time, in fact.","3975":"There, see? It\u2019s obvious.","3976":"Think I just did, didn\u2019t I?  I\u2019m sure that was me. .","3977":"Dunno.  Just sort of ... happens, really.  It\u2019s ... like a reflex. I can\u2019t stop it.","3978":"Coat.","3979":"Yeah, that\u2019s what I just noticed. I wonder why?","3980":"Piss off.","3981":"Of what?","3982":"Oh, it\u2019s way too weird for me. Go to the police; they\u2019re really excellent at dealing with this complicated sort of stuff. Tell them I sent you; that ought to get a reaction.","3983":"Night-night.","3984":"Yes, but I\u2019m very busy at the moment. I have to drink a cup of tea.","3985":"It\u2019s a cup of tea.","3986":"Really? That\u2019s bad luck, isn\u2019t it? Goodnight. Go away.","3987":"Stop talking. It makes me aware of your existence.","3988":"Handbag.","3989":"Handbag!","3990":"Stop. Wait!","3991":"Your life is not your own. Keep your hands off it, do you hear me?","3992":"Off it.  Off it.","3993":"Your skirt.","3994":"Look at the hem of it! That\u2019s what I noticed. I\u2019m ...  ... still catching up with my brain. It\u2019s terribly fast.","3995":"Those markings. Do you see them?","3996":"You only get marks like that by trapping the hem of your skirt in a car door but they\u2019re on the left-hand side, so you weren\u2019t driving; you were in the passenger seat.","3997":"There is no taxi waiting in the street outside. That\u2019s what I checked when I went to the window. And you\u2019ve got all the way to the door and not made any move to phone for one, and look at you. You didn\u2019t even bring a coat \u2013 in this rain? Now, well, that might mean nothing, except for the angle of the scars on your left forearm; you know, under that sleeve that you keep pulling down.","3998":"No, I didn\u2019t, so thank you for confirming my hypothesis. Don\u2019t really need to check that the angle\u2019s consistent with self-harm, do I?","3999":"Then you can keep your scars. I want to see your handbag.","4000":"It\u2019s too heavy. You said I was your last hope and now you\u2019re going out into the night with no plan on how you\u2019re getting home ... and a gun.","4001":"Chips.","4002":"You\u2019re suicidal. You\u2019re allowed chips, trust me. It\u2019s about the only perk.","4003":"I think I remember the way.  It\u2019s through there, isn\u2019t it?","4004":"Yeah, well, I\u2019ve got a friend with me, so ...","4005":"\u2019Bye!","4006":"Come on.","4007":"You see the fold in the middle? For the first few months you kept this hidden, folded inside a book.","4008":"Must have been a tightly packed shelf, going by the severity of the crease.","4009":"So obviously you were keeping it hidden from someone living in the same house at a level of intimacy where privacy could not be assumed.","4010":"Conclusion: relationship.","4011":"Not any more, though.","4012":"There\u2019s a pinprick at the top of the paper.","4013":"For the past few months it\u2019s been on open display on a wall. Conclusion: relationship is over.","4014":"The paper\u2019s been exposed to steam and a variety of cooking smells ...","4015":"... so it must have been on display in the kitchen.  Lots of different spices. You\u2019re suicidal, alone and strapped for cash, yet you\u2019re still cooking to impress. You\u2019re keen, then. The kitchen is the most public room in any house, but since any visitor could be expected to ask about a note like this, I have to assume you don\u2019t have any. You\u2019ve isolated yourself.","4016":"I know.","4017":"Hm.","4018":"Let\u2019s go for a walk.","4019":"Look at the fading pattern on the paper. It\u2019s not much but it\u2019s enough to know your kitchen window faces east. Now, kitchen noticeboards ...","4020":"By instinct we place them at eye level where there\u2019s natural light.","4021":"Now look: the sun\u2019s only struck the bottom two thirds ...  ... but the line is straight, so that means we know the paper is facing the window.","4022":"But because the top section is unaffected ...  ... we know the sunlight can only be entering the room at a steep angle.","4023":"If the sunlight was able to penetrate the room when the sun was lower in the sky ...","4024":"... then the paper would be equally faded top to bottom.","4025":"But no. It only makes it when the sun is at its zenith, so I\u2019m betting that you live in a narrow street on the ground floor.","4026":"Now, if steeply angled sunlight manages to hit eye level on the wall opposite the window, then what do we know about the room?","4027":"The room\u2019s small.","4028":"Literally.","4029":"I\u2019m sorry?","4030":"It\u2019s all about the blood.","4031":"This one comes from the very first night. You can see the pen marks over it. I think you discovered that pain stimulated your memory, so you tried it again later. I\u2019m no expert, but I assume that since your lover failed to notice an increasing number of scars over a period of months, that the relationship was no longer intimate.","4032":"Oh, well, because he would have done something about it.","4033":"Wouldn\u2019t he? Isn\u2019t that what you people do?","4034":"What is?","4035":"Superbly?","4036":"I\u2019m not sweet; I\u2019m just high.","4037":"This way.","4038":"I know. It\u2019s a plan.","4039":"Possibly. It\u2019s a long word.","4040":"\u201cBollocks.\u201d","4041":"D\u2019you know why I\u2019m going to take your case? Because of the one impossible thing you\u2019ve said.","4042":"You said your life turned on one word.","4043":"That\u2019s the impossible thing.

Who\u2019s next?","4462":"Justice?","4463":"You\u2019ll drop them into the sea.","4464":"Oh. That\u2019s nice. Try to tell me more about the plane.","4465":"So it\u2019s got to be one of the other two.","4466":"Now, Howard.","4467":"Howard\u2019s a lifelong drunk. Pallor of his skin, terminal gin blossoms on his red nose ...  ... and \u2013 terror notwithstanding \u2013 a bad case of the DTs.","4468":"There\u2019s no way he could have taken that shot from three hundred metres away.","4469":"So that leaves us with Alex.","4470":"Indentations on the temples suggest he habitually wears glasses. Frown lines suggest a lifetime of peering.","4471":"Laser surgery?","4472":"Excellent. Suddenly he sees himself in quite a different light now that he\u2019s dumped the specs. Even has a spray tan. But he\u2019s clearly not used to his new personal grooming ritual.","4473":"That can be told by the state of his fingernails and the fact that there\u2019s hair growing in his ears.  So it\u2019s a superficial job, then.","4474":"But he got his eyes fixed. His hands were steady. He pulled the trigger.","4475":"He killed Evans.","4476":"The plane, remember?","4477":"Alex.","4478":"I condemn Alex Garrideb.","4479":"John.","4480":"Don\u2019t let her distract you.","4481":"Soldiers today.","4482":"It\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry.","4483":"I don\u2019t have very long with you, so I just need you to tell me what you can see outside the plane.","4484":"Are there ships on it?","4485":"Is it a city?","4486":"Still here. Just give us a minute.","4487":"Is there really no-one there that can help you? Have you really, really checked?","4488":"We\u2019re going to do everything that we can.","4489":"It\u2019s all right. I ...","4490":"Yes, yes, yes, and this \u2013 I presume \u2013 will be their coffin.","4491":"Well, allowing for the entirely pointless courtesy of headroom, I\u2019d say this coffin is intended for someone of about five foot four. Makes it more likely to be a woman.","4492":"A child\u2019s coffin would be more expensive. This is in the lower price range, although still best available in that bracket.","4493":"This is a practical and informed choice. Balance of probability suggests that this is for an unmarried woman distant from her close relatives. That much is suggested by the economy of choice.","4494":"Acquainted with the process of death but unsentimental about the necessity of disposal. Also, the lining of the coffin ...","4495":"Don\u2019t be ridiculous. Look at the coffin. Unmarried, practical about death, alone.","4496":"Molly Hooper.","4497":"Yes.","4498":"What\u2019s she doing?","4499":"Yes, but why isn\u2019t she answering her phone?","4500":"Yes, but it\u2019s me calling.","4501":"Molly, I just want you to do something very easy for me, and not ask why.","4502":"No, it\u2019s not a game. I ... need you to help me.","4503":"It\u2019s not about that.","4504":"Molly, please, without asking why, just say these words.","4505":"I love you.","4506":"Molly, no, please, no, don\u2019t hang up! Do not hang up!","4507":"Please, I swear, you just have to listen to me.","4508":"Molly, this is for a case. It\u2019s ... it\u2019s a sort of experiment.","4509":"No, I know you\u2019re not an experiment. You\u2019re my friend. We\u2019re friends. But ... please. Just ... say those words for me.","4510":"It\u2019s very important. I can\u2019t say why, but I promise you it is.","4511":"Of course you can. Why can\u2019t you?","4512":"No, I don\u2019t know why.","4513":"Please, just say it. .","4514":"Why?","4515":"Well, if it\u2019s true, just say it anyway.","4516":"Say it anyway.","4517":"What?","4518":"I-I ...","4519":"I love you.","4520":"I love you.","4521":"Molly?","4522":"Molly, please.","4523":"Eurus, I won. I won.","4524":"Come on, play fair. The girl on the plane: I need to talk to her.","4525":"I won. I saved Molly Hooper.","4526":"No. No.","4527":"This isn\u2019t torture; this is vivisection. We\u2019re experiencing science from the perspective of lab rats.","4528":"Soldiers?","4529":"Hey, sis, don\u2019t mean to complain but this one\u2019s empty. What happened? Did you run out of ideas?","4530":"Well, what?","4531":"Stop it.","4532":"Please, for God\u2019s sake, just stop it.","4533":"Because, on balance, even your Lady Bracknell was more convincing.","4534":"Ignore everything he just said. He\u2019s being kind. He\u2019s trying to make it easy for me to kill him.","4535":"Which is why this is going to be so much harder.","4536":"Where would you suggest?","4537":"Moriarty?","4538":"What did they discuss?","4539":"Five minutes. It took her just five minutes to do all of this to us.","4540":"Well, not on my watch.","4541":"A moment ago, a brave man asked to be remembered.","4542":"I\u2019m remembering the governor.","4543":"Ten ...","4544":"Nine ...","4545":"Eight ...","4546":"Seven ...","4547":"Six ...","4548":"Five ...","4549":"Four ...","4550":"Three ...","4551":"Two ...","4552":"Yes. Yeah; no, I\u2019m-I\u2019m still here. I\u2019m here.","4553":"Yes, I know. Well, I\u2019m sorry about that. We-we-we must have got cut off. Um ...","4554":"How-how-how long was I away?","4555":"No, I-I am telling the truth. You can trust me.","4556":"I\u2019m not completely sure.","4557":"Um, now, I tell you what. You-you\u2019ve got to be really, really brave for me.","4558":"Can you go to the front of the plane? Can you do that?","4559":"Yes.","4560":"That\u2019s right; the front.","4561":"Yes, that\u2019s it.","4562":"Are you there yet?","4563":"John!","4564":"Where are you?","4565":"I\u2019m in another cell. I just spoke to the girl on the plane again. We\u2019ve been out for hours.","4566":"Yes.  The plane will keep flying until it runs out of fuel.","4567":"Is Mycroft with you?","4568":"Are you okay?","4569":"All right. Well, just keep exploring. Tell me anything you can about where you are.","4570":"What are you standing on?","4571":"What kind of bones?","4572":"Redbeard.","4573":"Oh, hello. Are you at the front of the plane now?","4574":"That\u2019s all right. What can you see now?","4575":"All right. Well, you and I are going to have to drive this plane together.  Just you and me.","4576":"Yeah, there\u2019s nothing to it. We just need to get in touch with some people on the ground.","4577":"Now, um, can you see anything that looks like a radio?","4578":"That\u2019s all right. Well, we ... keep looking. We\u2019ve got plenty of time.","4579":"What\u2019s wrong?","4580":"It\u2019s just turbulence. It\u2019s nothing to worry about.","4581":"Does the river look like it\u2019s getting closer?","4582":"All right, then. That means you\u2019re nearly home.","4583":"Why would there be a well in Sherrinford?","4584":"Why is there a draught?","4585":"Walls don\u2019t contract after you\u2019ve painted them.","4586":"Not real ones.","4587":"I\u2019m home. Musgrave Hall.","4588":"Yeah, it\u2019s just an old building. I don\u2019t care. The plane; tell me about the plane NOW!","4589":"Yeah, still not interested. The plane!","4590":"Eurus, let me speak to the little girl on the plane and I\u2019ll play any game you like.","4591":"John.","4592":"John.  John? Can you hear me? John!","4593":"John.","4594":"Try as long as possible not to drown.","4595":"I\u2019m going to find you. I am finding you!","4596":"Eurus, you said the answer\u2019s in the song ...","4597":"... but I went through the song line by line all those years ago ...","4598":"... and I found nothing. I couldn\u2019t find anything. And there-there was a beech tree in the grounds and I dug.","4599":"I dug and dug and dug and dug. Sixteen feet by six; sixteen yards; sixteen metres \u2013 and I found nothing. No-one.","4600":"Yes? They\u2019re dogs\u2019 bones. That\u2019s Redbeard.","4601":"Victor.","4602":"Victor Trevor.","4603":"We played pirates. I was Yellowbeard and he was ...","4604":"... he was Redbeard.","4605":"Oh. Oh God.","4606":"What ...  ... what did you do?","4607":"Victor.","4608":"You killed him.","4609":"You killed my best friend.","4610":"Okay. Okay, let\u2019s play.","4611":"Need your help. I\u2019m trying to solve a puzzle.","4612":"Well, the puzzle will save the plane.","4613":"The wrong dates. She used the wrong dates on the gravestones as the key to the cipher ...  ... and the cipher was the song.","4614":"Yes, it is. I\u2019ll be with you in a minute.","4615":"Hush, now. Working.","4616":"Let\u2019s number the words of the song.","4617":"Then rearrange the numbered words to match the sequence on the gravestones.","4618":"I ... am ... lost ... Help ... me ... brother ... Save ... My ... Life ... Before ... my ... Doom.","4619":"I ... am ... Lost ... Without ... your ... love ... Save ... My ... soul ... seek ... my ... room.","4620":"Oh God.","4621":"I think it\u2019s time you told me your real name.","4622":"But I\u2019m not a stranger, am I?","4623":"I\u2019m your brother.","4624":"I\u2019m here, Eurus.","4625":"The game, yes. I get it now.  The song was never a set of directions.","4626":"Look how brilliant you are. Your mind has created the perfect metaphor. You\u2019re high above us, all alone in the sky, and you understand everything except how to land.  Now, I\u2019m just an idiot, but I\u2019m on the ground.  I can bring you home.","4627":"No it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not too late.","4628":"Open your eyes. I\u2019m here.","4629":"You\u2019re not lost any more.","4630":"Now, you ... you just ... you just went the wrong way last time, that\u2019s all.  This time, get it right.  Tell me how to save my friend.","4631":"Eurus ...","4632":"Help me save John Watson.","4633":"How is he?","4634":"Oh, um. Mycroft \u2013 make sure he\u2019s looked after. He\u2019s not as strong as he thinks he is.","4635":"Thanks, Greg.","4636":"I said I\u2019d bring her home. I can\u2019t, can I?","4637":"Is that good?","4638":"He did his best.","4639":"Oh, there\u2019s Daddy!"}}
